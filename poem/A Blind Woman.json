    "She had turned her face up into",
    "a rain of light, and came on smiling.",
    "The light trickled down her forehead",
    "and into her eyes. It ran down",
    "into the neck of her sweatshirt",
    "and wet the white tops of her breasts.",
    "Her brown shoes splashed on",
    "into the light. The moment was like",
    "a circus wagon rolling before her",
    "through puddles of light, a cage on wheels,",
    "and she walked fast behind it,",
    "exuberant, curious, pushing her cane",
    "through the bars, poking and prodding,",
    "while the world cowered back in a corner."
