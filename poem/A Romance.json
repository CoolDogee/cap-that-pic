    "I saw a child set down her binder like a wall",
    "through the candy bin at the Corner Luncheonette",
    "so she could scoop out gum while she spoke to the clerk\u2014",
    "and from that moment was in love:",
    "College was supposed to straighten me",
    "like a bent tree strangled by a wire,",
    "but being done with sweetness I could not resist the lure of meat.",
    "How the red muscle gleamed in its shiny wrap,",
    "a wedge that had once been the thigh or the loin",
    "of a slow brute\u2019s body, sugar-dirt and clotted grass",
    "to be snatched in an instant",
    "and zipped into the crone-y-est of pocketbooks.",
    "Radiance housed in rawhide again, as when it was living.",
    "A steak can be stuck in your jeans when you\u2019re skinny,",
    "a rump roast is right for a puffy down coat,",
    "small chops will fit under a thin peasant blouse",
    "where it falls off the breasts",
    "like a woodland rive",
    "with a limestone amphitheater underneath.",
    "Ancient city, ancient sublet, ancient wooden fire escape\u2014",
    "with my other bandits I learned to say how-de-do in French.",
    "We were yanking on the cord that would start the motor of our lives",
    "though we did not have the choke adjusted yet.",
    "Sometimes it seemed I floated in the dregs like a tea bag",
    "bloating up with facts.",
    "Until a girl ran in the door, panting hard, face red,",
    "slab thudding",
    "from her snowflake-damasked waist onto the table,",
    "and we stood around it gawking at the way it seemed to breathe."
