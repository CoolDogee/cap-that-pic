    "Glued-on trees alternating with",
    "strips of bricks and little pieces of song",
    "taped up everywhere as green and pink diamonds",
    "in a woods in a box when the room of the mind",
    "has an easy chair and 3 large trees.",
    "A 3-sided woods with a divan at the back,",
    "an argyle of bird song on top",
    "of a syncopation of stapled trees,",
    "concrete strips and birches tacked up",
    "for",
    "if the room in the mind means",
    "3 large people conferring in a box of woods",
    "with a love seat out front.",
    "Bands of fluorescence and poplar",
    "and a tempo of tacked-up trees",
    "a needlepoint of bird song, home-sweet-home,",
    "where a sapling on an end table is lit",
    "stage right beside the wicker chair",
    "as well as the leather chair in the boxed woods.",
    "A gray-haired woman sits on the floor",
    "to read stacks of old journals out of a crate,",
    "a flaxen girl in a Scotch-plaid holiday dress",
    "who rolls in stage left.",
    "Pulses of gold and lam\u00e9 trees in French",
    "and a disco ball in the boxed-in woods,",
    "if the many-roomed mind comes with a futon.",
    "The off-kilter, out-of-sync,",
    "the irregular pace of, the size 3 of, until",
    "a (Do Not) diagonal across the mountain range",
    "at the back of the mind, sound-split poles, stubs",
    "but",
    "one by one, the leaves again taped up."
