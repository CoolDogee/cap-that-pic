    "Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine,",
    "Except these kisses of my lips on thine",
    "Brand them with immortality; but me \u2013",
    "Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea,",
    "Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold",
    "Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold",
    "And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind,",
    "Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind",
    "Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown,",
    "But in the light and laughter, in the moan",
    "And music, and in grasp of lip and hand",
    "And shudder of water that makes felt on land",
    "The immeasurable tremor of all the sea,",
    "Memories shall mix and metaphors of me."
