    "Think of a self-effacing missionary",
    "Tending the vices of a problem tribe.",
    "He knows the quickest cure for beri-beri",
    "And how to take a bribe.",
    "And so the mind will never say it\u2019s beaten",
    "By primitive disturbance of the liver;",
    "Its logic will prevent its being eaten,",
    "Get it across the river.",
    "But faced with this assured inconsequence",
    "That damns the very method that is used,",
    "It leaves the heart unproselytised and hence",
    "Admits that it\u2019s confused.",
    "I know I\u2019m acting, but I still must act.",
    "I melt to foolishness, and want it ended.",
    "Why it continues is this simple fact:",
    "I\u2019d hate to end it.",
    "For now the jungle moods assert their terms",
    "And there\u2019s no way to check them if they lie:",
    "The mind attempts to solve the thing, but squirms",
    "And knows exactly why.",
    "The world is everything that is the case.",
    "You cannot see it if you are inside it.",
    "That\u2019s why the tortoise always wins the race:",
    "the very terms decide it.",
    "I cannot help it if I am contented",
    "With being discontented that I falter:",
    "That\u2019s why psychology was first invented",
    "So that we needn\u2019t alter.",
    "It is a strange position to be in.",
    "It would be different if I didn\u2019t know",
    "Why the unlikely animal should win,",
    "Which cannibal should row.",
    "You\u2019d think there\u2019d be a way of cutting out",
    "Those self-destructive layers of introspection.",
    "To reach the truth at last without a doubt",
    "Of making the connection.",
    "That\u2019s why the missionary, on his guard,",
    "Is wondering why the cannibal\u2019s so merry,",
    "And why it is so very very hard",
    "To be a missionary."
