    "One of her hands one of her cheeks lay under,",
    "Cosening the pillow of a lawful kiss,",
    "Which therefore swell\u2019d, and seem\u2019d to part asunder,",
    "As angry to be robb\u2019d of such a bliss!",
    "The one look\u2019d pale and for revenge did long,",
    "While t\u2019other blush\u2019d, \u2019cause it had done the wrong.",
    "Out of the bed the other fair hand was",
    "On a green satin quilt, whose perfect white",
    "Look\u2019d like a daisy in a field of grass,",
    "And show\u2019d like unmelt snow unto the sight;",
    "There lay this pretty perdue, safe to keep",
    "The rest o\u2019 th\u2019 body that lay fast asleep.",
    "Her eyes (and therefore it was night), close laid",
    "Strove to imprison beauty till the morn:",
    "But yet the doors were of such fine stuff made,",
    "That it broke through, and show\u2019d itself in scorn,",
    "Throwing a kind of light about the place,",
    "Which turn\u2019d to smiles still, as\u2019t came near her face.",
    "Her beams, which some dull men call\u2019d hair, divided,",
    "Part with her cheeks, part with her lips did sport.",
    "But these, as rude, her breath put by still; some",
    "Wiselier downwards sought, but falling short,",
    "Curled back in rings, and seemed to turn again",
    "To bite the part so unkindly held them in."
