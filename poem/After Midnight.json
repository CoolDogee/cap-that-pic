    "The dark streets are deserted,",
    "With only a drugstore glowing",
    "Softly, like a sleeping body;",
    "With one white, naked bulb",
    "In the back, that shines",
    "On suicides and abortions.",
    "Who lives in these dark houses?",
    "I am suddenly aware",
    "I might live here myself.",
    "The garage man returns",
    "And puts the change in my hand,",
    "Counting the singles carefully."
