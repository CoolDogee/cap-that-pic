    "By a dismal cypress lying,",
    "Damon cried, all pale and dying,",
    "Kind is death that ends my pain,",
    "But cruel she I lov'd in vain.",
    "The mossy fountains",
    "Murmur my trouble,",
    "And hollow mountains",
    "My groans redouble:",
    "Ev'ry nymph mourns me,",
    "Thus while I languish;",
    "She only scorns me,",
    "Who caus'd my anguish.",
    "No love returning me, but all hope denying;",
    "By a dismal cypress lying,",
    "Like a swan, so sung he dying:",
    "Kind is death that ends my pain,",
    "But cruel she I lov'd in vain."
