    "at first she thinks the attraction does not",
    "fill her with enough blood , but",
    "with a thing like the dove \u2014 White and coloured",
    "feathers \u2014 Bones unlike her own",
    "bones that gravity can\u2019t pull down , a milky thing",
    "unlike the seas . Fills",
    "her with a wind \u2014 Starch rustle of the quick",
    "passing of things , then silence afterwards",
    "of the things that passed \u2014 that gave the wind",
    "its sound , not unlike what split",
    "the fireworks in the high school park into fanning particles",
    "of flame . The peacock that is the world , bird",
    "of breathing colour between them \u2014 Bird",
