    "Look, above the creek, hummingbirds in the trumpet vine.",
    "Not too close, wait. See the green blurs",
    "stitching the leaves?",
    "Here at the edge of the millennium",
    "I don\u2019t imagine",
    "you\u2019d call them anything as archaic as angels.",
    "But aren\u2019t they agents of a sort, and secret,",
    "dissolving and solidifying,",
    "spying from their constantly shifting perches of air,",
    "always nervous",
    "of us, risking only a stab",
    "in a bell of petals?",
    "Don\u2019t look so stunned, lay your pack",
    "in the needles and catch a breath. I know,",
    "you thought you knew me,",
    "and now to hear me talk this way ...",
    "I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve stopped pretending",
    "to love people",
    "and the cities where people can\u2019t love themselves.",
    "This is what the quiet accomplishes,",
    "and the water trusting",
    "the shadows to eventually peel back to the trees.",
    "Small wonder the angels are said to despise us.",
    "Still, without them",
    "how do we account for our meanness?",
    "Look at that, what else can promenade",
    "in the air? And how easily",
    "they\u2019re alarmed,",
    "revving off into the mist."
