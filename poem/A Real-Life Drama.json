    "This dog standing in the middle of the street,",
    "tail stiff, fur bushy with fear, and a pedigree rabbit,",
    "its neck broken and bleeding beneath his paws,",
    "might have been forgiven or simply taken away",
    "and shot under different circumstances",
    "and no one would have said much, except his owner",
    "who\u2019d gone out into the yard at the start",
    "of the commotion, having been involved",
    "at other times with the dog\u2019s truancies, and yelled,",
    "\u201cBosco, Bosco, goddamnit!\u201d but unavailing,",
    "and everyone understanding that once more Bosco",
    "had been taken over by the dark corner of his nature.",
    "But this other sentiment we shared as well: the man",
    "Who\u2019d raised the rabbit shouldn\u2019t husband something",
    "so rare and beautiful he couldn\u2019t keep it",
    "from the likes of Bosco."
