    "What of her glass without her? The blank gray",
    "There where the pool is blind of the moon\u2019s face.",
    "Her dress without her? The tossed empty space",
    "Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away.",
    "Her paths without her? Day\u2019s appointed sway",
    "Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place",
    "Without her? Tears, ah me! for love\u2019s good grace,",
    "And cold forgetfulness of night or day.",
    "What of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart,",
    "Of thee what word remains ere speech be still?",
    "A wayfarer by barren ways and chill,",
    "Steep ways and weary, without her thou art,",
    "Where the long cloud, the long wood\u2019s counterpart,",
    "Sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill."
