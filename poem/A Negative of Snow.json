    "Ice on the puddles,",
    "in the cups of fallen leaves.",
    "I\u2019d walk with Dad and a handful",
    "of other men, the setters working",
    "the fields, the underbrush.",
    "It was my job to carry the birds.",
    "I\u2019d have them all plucked",
    "by the time we got back to the car.",
    "On the walk out I\u2019d look",
    "for puddles I\u2019d missed",
    "and break them.",
    "Though many moonless nights",
    "have fallen on the grave",
    "like a negative of snow,",
    "Dad\u2019s wheelchair sometimes",
    "flashes in my mind, and I hear",
    "the bleating down the hall,",
    "a voice berating its god,",
    "his worthless anodynes,",
    "and the doctors who were",
    "at that very moment",
    "increasing his morphine,",
    "having failed to note",
    "the word",
    "on his chart,",
    "meaning that his damaged liver",
    "routed the opiates straight",
    "to his brain, his beautiful fragile brain,",
    "which I had not yet finished loving.",
    "My father, who still had manners,",
    "who was a hardwood, a tough tree.",
    "That was his first death."
