    "On the morning she became a young widow,",
    "my grandmother, startled by a sudden shadow,",
    "looked up from her work to see a hawk turn",
    "her prized rooster into a cloud of feathers.",
    "That same moment, halfway around the world",
    "in a Minnesota mine, her husband died,",
    "buried under a ton of rockfall.",
    "She told me this story sixty years ago.",
    "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true but it ought to be.",
    "She was a hard old woman, and though she knelt",
    "on Sundays when the acolyte\u2019s silver bell",
    "announced the moment of Christ\u2019s miracle,",
    "it was the darker mysteries she lived by:",
    "shiver-cry of an owl, black dog by the roadside,",
    "a tapping at the door and nobody there.",
    "The moral of the story was plain enough:",
    "miracles become a burden and require a priest",
    "to explain them. With signs, you only need",
    "to keep your wits about you and place your trust",
    "in a shadow world that lets you know hard luck",
    "and grief are coming your way. And for that",
    "\u2014so the story goes\u2014any day will do."
