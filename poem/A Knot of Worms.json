    "As day began to break, we passed",
    "the \u201chonk for worms\u201d sign,",
    "passed it honking again",
    "and again, to wake up the worms",
    "my dad said. It was only",
    "about another half mile to",
    "the aspen grove and our worm digs.",
    "The humus, spongy and almost",
    "black, turned over easily.",
    "I used my bare hands to put",
    "some moist earth into a coffee can",
    "and, as the aspen glittered",
    "in the risen sun, I gently",
    "slid the fresh, fat bait into my container.",
    "I heard the worms still in the ground",
    "gurgle as they tried to escape,",
    "while the ones in the can began",
    "to ball up as their numbers grew.",
    "Streamside, surrounded by mountains",
    "with snow lingering into summer,",
    "I picked out a worm and my dad",
    "arranged it on the hook to save",
    "my small fingers. Now you can purchase",
    "a time-share on that land.",
    "The colony of aspen, thinned",
    "by the builders, continues to",
    "tremble. No amount of honking",
    "brings back the worms."
