    "Framed by our window, skaters, winding",
    "in and out the wind, as water reeling",
    "so kept in motion, on a well-honed",
    "edge spin out a gilded ceiling.",
    "Fish, reflecting glow for glow,",
    "saints around the sun, are frozen",
    "with amazement just one pane below.",
    "Skates flash like stars, so madly",
    "whirling one can hardly tell which",
    "is sky and which the watery floor ...",
    "one night two straitlaced couples,",
    "a footman over them, rode out",
    "in a dappled-horse-drawn sleigh",
    "onto the river, a moonlit lark.",
    "The ice broke and they\u2014sleigh,",
    "footman and all\u2014riding in state,",
    "rode straight on into the lidded water.",
    "That winter all winter folks twirled",
    "over them who\u2014framed in lace,",
    "frost the furs, the shiny harness",
    "and their smiles the fire that keeps",
    "the place\u2014sat benignly watching.",
    "\u201cOne foot out, one foot in,",
    "are we real,\u201d thought one, \u201cwe who",
    "wander sheepishly in dreams, or they,",
    "the really sleepless eyes, under us?",
    "And every night who knows (a laughter",
    "troubles us like dreams) who skates",
    "(a thousand watch fires the stars)",
    "above, peering through the pane?\u201d"
