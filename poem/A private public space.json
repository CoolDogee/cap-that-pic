    "You can\u2019t trust lesbians. You invite them",
    "to your party and they don\u2019t come,",
    "they\u2019re too busy tending vaginal",
    "flowers, hating football, walking their golden",
    "and chocolate labs. X gave me a poem",
    "in which she was in love with a woman",
    "and the church but the church",
    "couldn\u2019t accept four breasts in one bed.",
    "When I asked if our coworkers knew,",
    "she dropped her head and I said nothing",
    "for years until this morning I realized",
    "no one reads poems: my secrets and hers",
    "are safe in verse. I knew she\u2019d have enjoyed",
    "the Beaujolais and I want to meet Dianne,",
    "Mona Lisa, Betty, Alice,",
    "the name\u2019s been changed",
    "to protect women who can\u2019t stand in a room",
    "holding hands because you can\u2019t trust",
    "heterosexuals to love love, however",
    "it comes. So I recorded",
    "the party for her, for them, the mic",
    "a bit away from the action",
    "to catch the feel of waves touching shore",
    "and letting go, the wash of moods",
    "across the hours of drink and yes, some grapes",
    "were thrown and I breathed",
    "the quickening revelation",
    "of a cigarette, someone said \u201cI gave up",
    "underwear for Lent\u201d and I hope",
    "they play the tape while making love.",
    "As if finally the world\u2019s made happy",
    "by who they are, laughing with, not at",
    "the nipple lick clit kiss hug",
    "in bed and after, the on and on",
    "of meals and moons and bills",
    "and burning days of pretending",
    "they don\u2019t exist. \u201cWho\u2019s she? Just",
    "a friend.\u201d And oceans are merely dew",
    "upon the land."
