    "Old Man Fray always matched his mules",
    "precisely like fitted pieces of a puzzle.",
    "The horses at the mill were perfect pairs.",
    "So it was not too far for him to travel",
    "from his valley over blue mountains",
    "to a distant Virginia county",
    "where Randolph slaves were darker,",
    "with molasses-colored Songhai skin,",
    "African kinked hair and mahogany eyes.",
    "He wanted to untie the weave",
    "of the Gordian Knot, complicated",
    "tangle he had created, with the issue",
    "of silk-haired Albert, his son,",
    "too fair to hide among the varied blacks.",
    "The journey was apology or shame.",
    "But cut or unwoven, the knotted",
    "weave leaves kinks too deep",
    "to hide or smooth away. Great-Grandma",
    "Rhoda, the woman Old Man Fray found,",
    "opulent with African genes, richly colored",
    "the complex threads of our generations."
