    "These days are best when one goes nowhere,",
    "The house a reservoir of quiet change,",
    "The creak of furniture, the window panes",
    "Brushed by the half-rhymes of activities",
    "That do not quite declare what thing it was",
    "Gave rise to them outside. The colours, even,",
    "Accord with the tenor of the day\u0097yes, \u2018grey\u2019",
    "You will hear reported of the weather,",
    "But what a grey, in which the tinges hover,",
    "About to catch, although they still hold back",
    "The blaze that's in them should the sun appear,",
    "And yet it does not. Then the window pane",
    "With a tremor of glass acknowledges",
    "The distant boom of a departing plane."
