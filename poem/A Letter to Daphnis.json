    "This to the crown and blessing of my life,",
    "The much loved husband of a happy wife;",
    "To him whose constant passion found the art",
    "To win a stubborn and ungrateful heart,",
    "And to the world by tenderest proof discovers",
    "They err, who say that husbands can\u2019t be lovers.",
    "With such return of passion as is due,",
    "Daphnis I love, Daphnis my thoughts pursue;",
    "Daphnis my hopes and joys are bounded all in you.",
    "Even I, for Daphnis\u2019 and my promise\u2019 sake,",
    "What I in women censure, undertake.",
    "But this from love, not vanity, proceeds;",
    "You know who writes, and I who \u2019tis that reads.",
    "Judge not my passion by my want of skill:",
    "Many love well, though they express it ill;",
    "And I your censure could with pleasure bear,",
    "Would you but soon return, and speak it here."
