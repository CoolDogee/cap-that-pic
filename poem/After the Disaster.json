    "One night, not long after the disaster,",
    "as our train was passing Astor,",
    "the car door opened with a shudder",
    "and a girl came flying down the aisle,",
    "hair that looked to be all feathers",
    "and a half-moon smile",
    "making open air of our small car.",
    "The crowd ignored her or they muttered",
    "\u201cHey, excuse me\u201d as they passed her",
    "when the train had paused at Rector.",
    "The specter crowed \u201cExcuse",
    ",\u201d swiftly",
    "turned, and ran back up the corridor,",
    "then stopped for me.",
    "We dove under the river.",
    "She took my head between her fingers,",
    "squeezing till the birds began to stir.",
    "And then from out my eyes and ears",
    "a flock came forth \u2014 I couldn\u2019t think or hear",
    "or breathe or see within that feather-world",
    "so silently I thanked her.",
    "Such things were common after the disaster."
