    "The Wise Men will unlearn your name.",
    "Above your head no star will flame.",
    "One weary sound will be the same\u2014",
    "the hoarse roar of the gale.",
    "The shadows fall from your tired eyes",
    "as your lone bedside candle dies,",
    "for here the calendar breeds nights",
    "till stores of candles fail.",
    "What prompts this melancholy key?",
    "A long familiar melody.",
    "It sounds again. So let it be.",
    "Let it sound from this night.",
    "Let it sound in my hour of death\u2014",
    "as gratefulness of eyes and lips",
    "for that which sometimes makes us lift",
    "our gaze to the far sky.",
    "You glare in silence at the wall.",
    "Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all.",
    "It's clear that you are now too old",
    "to trust in good Saint Nick;",
    "that it's too late for miracles.",
    "\u2014But suddenly, lifting your eyes",
    "to heaven's light, you realize:",
    "your",
    "is a sheer gift."
