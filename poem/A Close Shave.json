    "From Baden, or what\u2019s left of it,",
    "pursue a long, smooth curve of road",
    "that skirts the northern flood wall",
    "to parallel a palisade",
    "of channel markers sunk in earth,",
    "the folly of a cement works.",
    "Its blank silos overlook",
    "a pit of argillaceous shale,",
    "the fine and fossilized remains",
    "of bivalves, sponges, spines of shark,",
    "quarried and burnt with limestone charge",
    "to alchemize a binder of brick",
    "and the city\u2019s shallow, brittle crust.",
    "Around a bend, the riverbed",
    "swings wide to open a fetch of field.",
    "Shadows skim its mucky thaw",
    "as juncos, whisked about by the wind",
    "on courses neither fixed nor free,",
    "give but a quick metallic chink.",
    "Behind you, rain has wrapped the bluffs",
    "and scumbled limbs of sycamores.",
    "Ahead, each bend assumes the name",
    "of a gaudy packet run aground,",
    "or snagged and sunk, or blown to bits:",
    "for one, the side-wheel Amazon,",
    "pluperfect wheelhouse painted green,",
    "that struck a honey-locust pike",
    "still rooted deep in river mud",
    "and tore its hull from stem to stern.",
    "Down in minutes! Within the month",
    "an island silted up behind.",
    "A flock of luggage floated south,",
    "remarked by those on Water Street",
    "loafing before the trading post",
    "and the barbershop of Madame Krull.",
    "She can",
    "be found",
    "at work in her elaborate room",
    "to clip and coif",
    "or wield her razor with great skill",
    "for those who favor her with their chins.",
    "The scent of ginger tonic blends",
    "with that of borscht, its acrid tang,",
    "consumed behind a wooden screen",
    "as Illinois grows dark. In this,",
    "her second year since coming west."
