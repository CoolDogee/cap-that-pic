    "You could almost think the word synonymous",
    "with",
    ", given our so far narrow",
    "history, and the excessive esteem",
    "in which we have been led to hold what is,",
    "in this case, our rightly designated",
    "nervous systems. Little wonder then",
    "that some presume the mind itself both part",
    "and parcel of the person, the very seat",
    "of soul and, lately, crucible for a host",
    "of chemical incentives\u2014combinations",
    "of which can pretty much answer for most",
    "of our habits and for our affections.",
    "When even the handy lexicon cannot",
    "quite place the",
    "as anything beyond",
    "one rustic ancestor of reason, you might",
    "be satisfied to trouble the odd term",
    "no further\u2014and so would fail to find",
    "your way to it, most fruitful faculty",
    "untried. Dormant in its roaring cave,",
    "the heart\u2019s intellective aptitude grows dim,",
    "unless you find a way to wake it. So,",
    "let\u2019s try something, even now. Even as",
    "you tend these lines, attend for a moment",
    "to your breath as you draw it in: regard",
    "the breath\u2019s cool descent, a stream from mouth",
    "to throat to the furnace of the heart.",
    "Observe that queer, cool confluence of breath",
    "and blood, and do your thinking there."
