    "Delight of Human kind, and Gods above;",
    "Parent of Rome; Propitious Queen of Love;",
    "Whose vital pow\u2019r, Air, Earth, and Sea supplies;",
    "And breeds what e\u2019r is born beneath the rowling Skies:",
    "For every kind, by thy prolifique might,",
    "Springs, and beholds the Regions of the light:",
    "Thee, Goddess thee, the clouds and tempests fear,",
    "And at thy pleasing presence disappear:",
    "For thee the Land in fragrant Flow\u2019rs is drest,",
    "For thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy breast;",
    "And Heav\u2019n it self with more serene, and purer light is blest.",
    "For when the rising Spring adorns the Mead,",
    "And a new Scene of Nature stands display\u2019d,",
    "When teeming Budds, and chearful greens appear,",
    "And Western gales unlock the lazy year,",
    "The joyous Birds thy welcome first express,",
    "Whose native Songs thy genial fire confess:",
    "Then savage Beasts bound o\u2019re their slighted food,",
    "Strook with thy darts, and tempt the raging floud:",
    "All Nature is thy Gift; Earth, Air, and Sea:",
    "Of all that breathes, the various progeny,",
    "Stung with delight, is goaded on by thee.",
    "O\u2019er barren Mountains, o\u2019er the flow\u2019ry Plain,",
    "The leavy Forest, and the liquid Main",
    "Extends thy uncontroul\u2019d and boundless reign.",
    "Through all the living Regions dost thou move,",
    "And scattr\u2019st, where thou goest, the kindly seeds of Love:",
    "Since then the race of every living thing,",
    "Obeys thy pow\u2019r; since nothing new can spring",
    "Without thy warmth, without thy influence bear,",
    "Or beautiful, or lovesome can appear,",
    "Be thou my ayd: My tuneful Song inspire,",
    "And kindle with thy own productive fire;",
    "While all thy Province Nature, I survey,",
    "And sing to Memmius an immortal lay",
    "Of Heav\u2019n, and Earth, and every where thy wond\u2019rous pow\u2019r display.",
    "To Memmius, under thy sweet influence born,",
    "Whom thou with all thy gifts and graces dost adorn.",
    "The rather, then assist my Muse and me,",
    "Infusing Verses worthy him and thee.",
    "Mean time on Land and Sea let barb\u2019rous discord cease,",
    "And lull the listening world in universal peace.",
    "To thee, Mankind their soft repose must owe,",
    "For thou alone that blessing canst bestow;",
    "Because the brutal business of the War",
    "Is manag\u2019d by thy dreadful Servant\u2019s care:",
    "Who oft retires from fighting fields, to prove",
    "The pleasing pains of thy eternal Love:",
    "And panting on thy breast, supinely lies,",
    "While with thy heavenly form he feeds his famish\u2019d eyes:",
    "Sucks in with open lips, thy balmy breath,",
    "By turns restor\u2019d to life, and plung\u2019d in pleasing death.",
    "There while thy curling limbs about him move,",
    "Involv\u2019d and fetter\u2019d in the links of Love,",
    "When wishing all, he nothing can deny,",
    "Thy charms in that auspicious moment try;",
    "With winning eloquence our peace implore,",
    "And quiet to the weary World restore."
