    "This youth too long has heard the break",
    "Of waters in a land of change.",
    "He goes to see what suns can make",
    "From soil more",
    "and strange.",
    "He cuts what holds his days together",
    "And shuts him in, as lock on lock:",

    "The",
    "of a clock;",
    "Seeking, I think, a light that waits",
    "Still as a lamp upon a shelf, \u2014",
    "A land with hills like rocky gates",
    "Where no sea leaps upon itself.",
    "But he will find that nothing dares",
    "To be enduring, save where, south",
    "Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares",
    "On beauty with a rusted mouth, \u2014",
    "Where something dreadful and another",
    "Look quietly upon each other."
