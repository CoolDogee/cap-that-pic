    "The shed behind the barn behind the red cottage I wait",
    "for her in the fescue grass the rye I hear it grow over me",

    "I hear myself say)",

    "I\u2019ll wait behind Cobb\u2019s barn watching the distant houses",
    "She will come down this road my shadow is paving for her",
    "a stalk of honey and the rye grass grows from her arms",
    "(She was raised in these hills looking down on Elk Creek)",
    "and behind her the bluegrass it\u2019s reaching to touch her ankle"
