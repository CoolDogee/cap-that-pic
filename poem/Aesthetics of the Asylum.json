    "The sober reality",
    "Was a double line of orphans in blue smocks",
    "Marching above the blue river",
    "Under the smoky eye of winter.",
    "It is possible to envy them;",
    "The picture of which they formed a part",
    "Was so well composed,",
    "In shades of blue and smoke",
    "And the dull brick red of the asylum walls;",
    "How orderly and tranquil the effect",
    "Of the wintry ranks of children",
    "Under the silent sky."
