    "Whenever I touch the cairn",
    "marking the summit",
    "of one of my parents,",

    "an animal caution comes over me,",
    "sinew and muscle like the brook\u2019s,",
    "a sudden shivering",
    "green-brown flame.",
    "Soon they will be constellations,",
    "and I a small tower of stones."
