    "Held in a late season",
    "At a shifting of worlds,",
    "In the golden balance of autumn,",
    "Out of love and reason",
    "We made our peace;",
    "Stood still in October",
    "In the failing light and sought,",
    "Each in the other, ease",
    "And release from silence,",
    "From the slow damnation",
    "Of speech that is weak",
    "And falls from silence.",
    "In the October sun",
    "By the green river we spoke,",
    "Late in October, the leaves",
    "Of the water maples had fallen.",
    "But whatever we said",
    "In the bright leaves was lost,",
    "Quick as the leaf-fall,",
    "Brittle and blood red.",
    "For Kenneth Rexroth, 1950"
