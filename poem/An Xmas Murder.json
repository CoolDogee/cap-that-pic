    "Three years now, and we\u2019re still finding our way;",
    "Newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes,",

    "Spirit at work, North Country justice\u0097",
    "A case I just happened to be involved in.",
    "No, please\u0097all right, if you are having one.\u201d",
    "He holds his glass aloft and then lets fall",
    "A silence that has grown familiar to us",
    "From other stories told on other days,",
    "The will to recount building its head of steam.",
    "\u201cWell, now, you have to know about the victim.",
    "His name was Charlie Deudon, no doubt Canuck",
    "Stock some generations back, but he",
    "Nor no one else could tell you\u0097if they cared.",
    "Deudons had been dirt farmers here as long",
    "As anybody knew. They never starved",
    "But never had a dime to spare, either.",
    "Charlie resolved to change the Deudon luck.",
    "And that\u2019s just what he did. Or almost did. . . .",
    "He\u2019d graduated two classes ahead of mine;",
    "We knew each other, naturally, but not",
    "On terms of friendship. Fact is, he had no friends,",
    "And only one girlfriend, whom he married",
    "Day after Commencement, June of \u201832.",
    "And then he set to work and never stopped",
    "Again, until they made him stop for good.\u201d",

    "Of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor.",
    "He was unnatural.",
    "he made that farm",
    "Into a showplace, a kind of 4-H model.",
    "He made good money, yes, but not a dollar",

    "And there was more. A boy that he had hired,",
    "By the name of Carroll Giddens, was their buddy.",
    "Likeable fellow, regulation issue,",
    "The sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth",
    "In half a shake and tells off-color stories",
    "Till he\u2019s got them choked to death with laughing.",
    "\u2018Course the wisecracks they loved best were those",
    "About poor Charlie and his gold-plated farm. . . .",
    "Just one more case of what\u2019s been often said",
    "By commentators on democracy\u0097",
    "How it helps everyone keep modest.\u201d",
    "Teasing mischief has crept into his voice.",
    "A self-taught anthropologist as well",
    "As teller of tales, he has other frames",
    "Of reference to place around events",
    "Local or international. He knows",
    "That things can stand for more than what they are;",
    "Indeed, says standing for things is why we\u2019re here,",
    "And quotes chapter and verse to prove his point.",
    "\u201cThink of the worldwide scapegoat ritual.",
    "In halfway civilized societies",
    "An animal\u2019s the one relieved from life",
    "Duty, am I right? A fellow tribesman",
    "Will do in a pinch, if animals are lacking,",
    "Or if communal fears get screwed too tight. . . .",
    "Anyhow, it was clear that something more",
    "Than common envy stirred up the lynch law.",
    "Their own failure\u2019s what they wanted dead.\u201d",
    "Seconds pass in silence as he stares",
    "At something\u0097perhaps a knothole in the pine",
    "Floorboard. He looks up, eyebrows raised,",
    "And twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers.",
    "A coil of rope hung on the wall, we see,",
    "Has made him pause and heave experienced sighs.",
    "\u201cHere. Have another. So: was Charlie punished?\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you\u0097better me than others.",
    "You see, I was involved\u0097no, no, no,",
    "Not in the deed, Lord, no, just as a witness.",
    "It happened this way\u0097hope you\u2019re not squeamish.",
    "Charlie had this boy to help with chores,",
    "The one named Carroll. Married, two kids, I think.",
    "Not too reliable. But so few are;",
    "Nor could you call his wages generous.",
    "His buddies must have stood him drinks, is all",
    "I can say. He\u2019d a skinful half the time\u0097",
    "Was certainly drunk that Christmas Eve morning.",
    "No reason to doubt what Charlie told his wife.",
    "Charlie\u2019d been up to help at six with the milking,",
    "And Carroll, drunk as a fiddler\u2019s bitch, was there",
    "Loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow.",
    "He took a slip and the whole business spilled.",
    "Wooden handle clipped him in the side,",
    "And he fell, too, right in the puddle of milk.",
    "And started",
    ". Charlie, you can guess,",

    "\u2018Comes out of next week\u2019s paycheck,\u2019 Charlie says.",
    "And then the trouble starts, with Carroll swearing",
    "And yelping, till Charlie gives him a little tap",
    "And goes indoors. By then Carroll could tell",
    "The barrow handle had cracked a rib or two.",
    "He drove into town to see his doctor\u0097that",
    "Wasn\u2019t me\u0097and word went out that Charlie",
    "Had roughed up his innocent assistant.",
    "That\u2019s all they needed, Carroll\u2019s friends.",
    "Time that stuck-up bastard got his due,",
    "He\u2019s gone too far this time, but we\u2019ll show him,",
    "Et cetera . . . . As it was Christmas Eve,",
    "They had the leisure, the liquor, and the rope.\u201d",
    "\u201cThey hanged him?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s not our way up here.",
    "The honored custom\u2019s to dump them in the river.",
    "You see, the river\u2019s New Hampshire all the way",
    "Over to the Vermont side, and thus,",
    "the victim\u2019s still alive when he hits the water,",
    "New Hampshire law enforcement and legal justice",
    "Steps in. It tends to confuse the issue, see?",
    "In wintertime, the river freezes over,",
    "And you can\u2019t hope to fish the bodies out",
    "Till the month of March at the earliest.",
    "By then, who knows which state the victim died in?",
    "A trick they\u2019ve played a hundred years and more",
    "Up in Woodsville, where the bridge is. That\u2019s where",
    "The loggers used to go to spend their money",
    "On booze and hookers\u0097who\u2019d arrange for them",
    "To get knocked in the head at the right moment,",
    "And pitched off the bridge into the water.",
    "A famous local industry, but rather",
    "Fallen on hard days by the early fifties,",
    "Just like others more legitimate. . . .",
    "Well, our local rowdies knew the routine,",
    "And, when time came to follow up their threats,",
    "They laid their plans according to tradition.",
    "They knew that Charlie\u2019d have to do the milking",
    "Christmas morning same as every day.",
    "And when he came into the barn to do it,",
    "They\u2019d be waiting for him. And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d",
    "We strain forward to hear him tell the rest;",
    "The narrative spell is on him, and on us.",
    "His voice weaves through fine-tuned nuances,",
    "With sudden leaps in volume and skittish phrases",
    "That somehow help flesh out what he describes.",
    "We see the sprawling barn across the highway",
    "From the white-columned porch of the old house.",
    "See the barn closed up tight against the cold,",
    "And the blue-gray light of December dawn",
    "As Charlie crosses the road to do his chores.",
    "The roosters shriek their morning alarm, the big",
    "Doors creak open on the darkness\u0097a darkness",
    "Slit with tight-strung wires of light knifing",
    "Through cracks between the boards of the east wall.",
    "Tufts of hay spill from cribs on both sides.",
    "The waiting cattle stir and low as daylight",
    "Breaks in on the darkness. Their master strides",
    "In past the parked pickup truck, his pail,",
    "A battered Rath Blackhawk lard can swinging",
    "At his side, a whistled \u201cJingle Bells\u201d",
    "His fight song for the working holiday.",
    "He hears the verses harnessed to his whistling,",
    "The tune drawing its text along march tempo:",
    "And then all changes. Smash of the blackjack",
    "Against his skull, exploding carnival",
    "Of fire-veined shock that flies to the far corners",
    "Of night. Four assailants leap from the back",
    "Of the truck and lift him partly erect, the quicker",
    "To bind his arms behind and truss them to",
    "His half-bent legs, as you might rope a steer",
    "Or sheep you meant to brand or slaughter.",
    "They take him out to where the car is waiting",
    "And throw him in the trunk like a sack of feed.",
    "Another car drives past but doesn\u2019t slow.",
    "The bandits duck and climb inside their own.",
    "Tires screech, the driver slams onto the highway,",
    "A smile and wink all round as they drive north",
    "To Woodsville. The sun is coming up when they",
    "Reach the bridge and stop the car. The lid",
    "Of the trunk\u2019s sprung open, its cargo discharged.",
    "He is dragged to the railing, lifted, then heaved over.",
    "The body falls, seeming almost to pause",
    "In air before it hits the water and slides",
    "Below the surface of the floating ice. . . .",
    "Five miles back along the highway, the dark",
    "Barn, the herd, a crushed tin pail, and signs",
    "Of struggle in the dirt wait for someone\u2019s",
    "Startled face, back-lit in the doorway,",
    "To see them, then whip aside with a shout of terror.",
    "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t found until spring thaw; he washed",
    "Ashore just south of Bradford, still tied up",
    "And looking like they\u2019d tarred and feathered him\u0097",
    "Partly decomposed, but not his clothes.",
    "First thing was an autopsy to test if he",
    "Had died by drowning or was dead before",
    "Going under. Conclusion was, he\u2019d died",
    "On land, so as I said, his death belonged",
    "To the Green Mountain State\u2019s criminal justice.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd what about the killers\u0097were they caught?\u201d",
    "\u201cSeveral suspects found themselves in jail\u0097",
    "And that\u2019s where I come in: as star witness.",
    "It happened I was on the road that morning.",
    "Real early. See . . . I\u2019d promised my house guest",
    "Of the night\u0097young Marine on leave\u0097I\u2019d drive",
    "Him back to Lebanon to grab his bus.",
    "I always keep my word, especially",
    "When given in the night hours. Nice boy\u0097",
    "He\u2019s been a good friend ever since. We\u2019d said",
    "Good-bye until the next three-day pass.",
    "Well, I was driving home like Merry Christmas.",
    "Into the headlights comes the Deudon farm:",
    "And then I noticed the car. A two-toned Kaiser,",
    "Side of the road, beneath a maple tree.",
    "Didn\u2019t know whose it was or why it was there.",
    "I saw one face, Calvin Renfrew\u2019s, that\u2019s all.",
    "He didn\u2019t",
    "wheels so far as I knew.",
    "Occurred to me right then that something might",
    "Be fishy; but locals never meddle till\u0097",
    "Till it\u2019s too late, sometimes. I should have stopped.",
    "They might have banged me on the head, but then\u0097.",
    "Well, even as it is they got revenge.",
    "I\u2019m still alive, however, and mean to stay so.\u201d",
    "He laughs a low laugh that would chill the devil . . .",
    "Then takes up the thread\u0097how when he heard the news",
    "About Charlie\u2019s disappearance, he drove down",
    "To tell the state trooper what he\u2019d seen.",
    "\u201cThat was the very next day after Christmas.",
    "By nightfall Calvin Renfrew and Norbert Joiner,",
    "The owner of the car (the Kaiser), and two",
    "Associates were in custody. But not",
    "For long. Someone bailed them out, someone",
    "Rich, it had to be, an enemy",
    "Or rival of Charlie\u2019s. That\u2019s often our way,",
    "You know, to let others fix the person",
    "We secretly hate, then give them secret help",
    "When they get their paws burned in the process.",
    "A lot of people coveted that farm,",
    "However much disparaged it was in public.",
    "When Charlie\u2019s widow put it up for auction,",
    "Don\u2019t imagine nobody came to bid.",
    "I still see things of his on others\u2019 farms.",
    "What didn\u2019t surprise me either\u2019s how the town,",
    "Lord help me, the whole county took the side",
    "Of those arrested against the murdered man.",
    "They said old Charlie had it coming to him,",
    "Treating his employee that way. Meanwhile,",
    "Carroll had quietly slipped across the border",
    "To Canada; no way to prove that he\u2019d",
    "Hardly been hurt at all. So rumor flew.",
    "If words could put you under ground, why Carroll",
    "Was dead and buried six times over, a martyr",
    "Hounded to his grave by a maniac",
    "Who should have been taken care of years ago.",
    "These are churchgoing people, too, but they",
    "Figure they have a special insight as",
    "To what the Boy Upstairs considers right.",
    "Man is born for sorrow, so we\u2019re told,",
    "And some try to make sure he gets a close",
    "Acquaintance with the sorrow that\u2019s his due.",
    "Meanwhile, if you can say the things people",
    "Want to hear, then you may lynch at will.\u201d",
    "He folds his hands and brings them to his chin.",
    "\u201cThe rest of the story you can figure out",
    "Yourself. Their lawyer asked the jury be",
    "Directed by the judge to return a verdict",
    "Of Not Guilty. Motion granted\u0097as never",
    "Before for a capital offense in",
    "state.",
    "They\u2019d do it again, don\u2019t worry, if the case",
    "Was dear to their concerns. Sounds cynical,",
    "I grant you. . . . But then, you see, they started next",
    "On me for fingering the guilty parties.",
    "State trooper drops by to ask some questions.",
    "Why was I on the highway that time of morning?",
    "Oh? And who exactly was this friend?",
    "Oh, really? Stayed the night, did he? I see. . . .",
    "A doubt or two\u2019d been raised before already,",
    "Given that I had never married,",
    "Was locally famous for my special hobby.",
    "I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve told you: I play a little pipe",
    "Organ at church sometimes\u0097I even travel",
    "To play it elsewhere. I know organists",
    "All over New England, and the town gazette",
    "Used always to mention when I went to play",
    "At musicales in other towns and states.",
    "Nobody thought it mattered much beforehand,",
    "But once the tale about the serviceman",
    "Got out, my friends, well, you can just imagine.",
    "Overnight young Dr. Stephens was",
    "As \u2018musical\u2019 as you can be and not",
    "Get tarred and feathered. My patients, some of them,",
    "Began to melt away like ice cream. Stephens,",
    "A local name, respected in these parts,",
    "Became a byword for things we don\u2019t discuss.",
    "I wondered whether I should move, of course;",
    "Some rowdy threw a can of paint at the house;",
    "I still get unsigned letters from time to time.",
    "Things must be better where you two come from.",
    "But this is where I\u2019ve always lived, it\u2019s what",
    "I know. If I had had the sense to pitch",
    "Someone unpopular from off a bridge",
    "Instead of enjoying music, chances are",
    "I\u2019d be a favorite son. In point of fact,",
    "I\u2019ve given up the organ, seldom play it",
    "Nowadays. I\u2019ve got a different hobby\u0097",
    "Your health, gentlemen! No more today, though.",
    "Another call to make this afternoon.",
    "But listen, now: if you\u2019ll come up to me",
    "Next week, I\u2019ll play some pump organ for you.",
    "I can still do a rousing \u2018Hornpipe\u2019\u0097the one",
    "By Handel. Tourist attraction hereabouts.",
    "I am fairly confident you won\u2019t",
    "Ever have heard it played my way before.\u201d",
    "He stands to go, consenting to be ushered",
    "Out under the black trees of late March, down",
    "To where his battered station wagon sits.",
    "Thunder of engines takes him off. . . . But his words",
    "Stay lodged in us like arrows, arrows aimed",
    "As carefully as acupuncture and meant",
    "Somehow to warn or counsel. Not that warnings",
    "In the abstract often help stave off",
    "Particular misfortunes, inevitably",
    "The body of most stories drawn from life.",
    "Misfortunes are the hinges life turns on?",
    "Reprieves as well\u0097along with persons, places,",
    "Passions. A fluent paradox, the realm",
    "Normally termed external, I mean its way",
    "Of overhearing thought and mustering",
    "Fresh evidence. . . . Today, for instance, how",
    "New green on branches and a liquid birdcall",
    "Suffice to announce the chaste approach of spring."
