    "not even lost in death the memory",
    "of why we burned, and therefore still",
    "a fire consuming all obsequious delay,",
    "now polvo, dust, of a desire but still alive",
    "and aching, not even lost to you",
    "within our common urn, urgent as an ash",
    "still burning alma, soul, still",
    "and moving toward you, la muerte, my amor\u2014",
    "not even lost in death, memoria,",
    "and feeling some reply, alma, memory and ash,",
    "ash burning still, still",
    "and moving toward you, dust and dust, ash",
    "alma and amor constante",
    "m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la muerte, constant",
    "even in our common urn, polvo enamorado."
