    "The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept",
    "And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may",
    "Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,",
    "Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.",
    "He leaned above me, thinking that I slept",
    "And could not hear him; but I heard him say,",
    "\u2018Poor child, poor child\u2019: and as he turned away",
    "Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.",
    "He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold",
    "That hid my face, or take my hand in his,",
    "Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:",
    "He did not love me living; but once dead",
    "He pitied me; and very sweet it is",
    "To know he still is warm though I am cold."
