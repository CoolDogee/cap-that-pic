    "I was looking for your hair,",
    "black as old lava on an island",
    "of white coral. I dreamed it",
    "deserted you and came for me,",
    "wrapped me in its funeral ribbons",
    "and tied me a bow of salt.",
    "Here\u2019s where I put my demise:",
    "desiring fire in a web of tide,",
    "marrying the smell of wet ashes",
    "to the sweet desert of your slate.",
    "My intelligent mammal, male",
    "of my species, twin sun to a world",
    "not of my making, you reduce me",
    "to the syrup of the moon, you boil",
    "my bones in the absence of hands.",
    "Where is your skin, parting me?",
    "Where is the cowlick under your kiss",
    "teasing into purple valleys? Where",
    "are your wings, the imaginary tail",
    "and its exercise? Where would I breed",
    "you? In the neck of my secret heart",
    "where you\u2019ll go to the warmth of me",
    "biting into that bread where crumbs crack",
    "and scatter and feed us our souls;",
    "if only you were a stone I could",
    "throw, if only I could have you."
