    "It\u2019s up and away from our work to-day,",
    "For the breeze sweeps over the down;",
    "And it\u2019s hey for a game where the gorse blossoms flame,",
    "And the bracken is bronzing to brown.",
    "With the turf \u2019neath our tread and the blue overhead,",
    "And the song of the lark in the whin;",
    "There\u2019s the flag and the green, with the bunkers between\u2014",
    "Now will you be over or in?",
    "The doctor may come, and we\u2019ll teach him to know",
    "A tee where no tannin can lurk;",
    "The soldier may come, and we\u2019ll promise to show",
    "Some hazards a soldier may shirk;",
    "The statesman may joke, as he tops every stroke,",
    "That at last he is high in his aims;",
    "And the clubman will stand with a club in his hand",
    "That is worth every club in St. James\u2019.",
    "The palm and the leather come rarely together,",
    "Gripping the driver\u2019s haft,",
    "And it\u2019s good to feel the jar of the steel",
    "And the spring of the hickory shaft.",
    "Why trouble or seek for the praise of a clique?",
    "A cleek here is common to all;",
    "And the lie that might sting is a very small thing",
    "When compared with the lie of the ball.",
    "Come youth and come age, from the study or stage,",
    "From Bar or from Bench\u2014high and low!",
    "A green you must use as a cure for the blues\u2014",
    "You drive them away as you go.",
    "We\u2019re outward bound on a long, long round,",
    "And it\u2019s time to be up and away:",
    "If worry and sorrow come back with the morrow,",
    "At least we\u2019ll be happy to-day."
