    "A blind man was riding an unheated train,",
    "From Bryansk he was traveling home with his fate.",
    "Fate whispered to him so the whole car could hear:",
    "And why should you care about blindness and war?",
    "It\u2019s good, she was saying, you\u2019re sightless and poor.",
    "If you were not blind, you\u2019d never survive.",
    "The Germans won\u2019t kill you, you\u2019re nothing to them.",
    "Allow me to lift that bag on your shoulder\u2014",
    "The one with the holes, the empty torn one.",
    "Let me just raise your eyelids wide open.",
    "The blind man was traveling home with his fate,",
    "Now thankful for blindness. Happy about it."
