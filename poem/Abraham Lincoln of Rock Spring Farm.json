    "I",
    "Along the Wilderness Road, through Cumberland Gap,",
    "The black ox hours limped toward Sunday\u2019s sun,",
    "Across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone,",
    "Where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush",
    "From February\u2019s fang and claw; the stars,",
    "Blue white, like sheer icicles, spired aglow",
    "As if the three wise men barged in the East",
    "Or priests in sackcloth balked the Scourge of God.",
    "Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law,",
    "The scrubby log cabin dared the compass points",
    "Of Rock Spring farm, man\u2019s world, God\u2019s universe,",
    "The babel of the circumstance and era.",
    "The frozen socket of its window stared",
    "Beyond the spayed crabapple trees, to where",
    "The skulls of hills, the skeletons of barrens,",
    "Lay quiet as time without the watch\u2019s tick.",
    "Not knowing muck and star would vie for him,",
    "The man Tom sank upon ax-split stool,",
    "Hands fisted, feet set wide to brace the spirit,",
    "Big shoulders shoved, dark hazel eyes glazed by",
    "Grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced",
    "Up, up, the stick-clay chimney. While fire imps combed",
    "The black and bristling hair, the acids of thoughts",
    "Made of the orby face an etching-plate.",
    "II",
    "Near pyrotechnic logs, the purling kettle,",
    "Aunt Peggy puffed her pipe on God\u2019s rich time:",
    "A granny at a childbed on the border,",
    "Where head and backbone answered the tomahawk",
    "Her wise old eyes had seen a hundred Nancys",
    "In travail tread the dark winepress alone;",
    "Her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed",
    "Into the outer world of pitch and toss.",
    "The cabin that her myth and mission entered",
    "Became a castle in which Aunt Peggy throned",
    "A dynasty of grunts and nods and glances.",
    "The nest, the barn, the hovel had schooled her in",
    "The ABC of motherhood, and somehow",
    "She\u2019d lost her ego in the commonweal:",
    "She sensed so accurately a coming child",
    "That rakes dubbed her the St. Bernard of Sex!",
    "And now her keyhole look explored Tom Lincoln",
    "Beneath the patched homespun, the hue and cry",
    "Of malice, until she touched his loneliness,",
    "The taproot that his fiber gave no tongue.",
    "Then, lulling the wife, troubled in flesh and mind,",
    "She eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while:",
    "There\u2019s but one way of coming into the world,",
    "And seven times seventy ways of leaving it!",
    "III",
    "The woman Nancy, like a voyager sucked",
    "Into the sea\u2019s whale belly by a wreck,",
    "Buoyed to the surface air of consciousness",
    "And clutched the solace of her corn-husk bed.",
    "Her dark face, sharped in forehead, cheekbone, chin,",
    "Cuddled in dark brown hair; her eyes waxed grayer",
    "With wonder of the interlude: her beauty",
    "And courage choked Aunt Peggy\u2019s hyperbole!",
    "Out of the fog of pain, the bog of bygones,",
    "The bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle,",
    "She picked the squares to piece tomorrow\u2019s quilt:",
    "She puzzled now, as then, about her father",
    "Who let wild Lucy Hanks bundle and carry",
    "Flesh of his flesh beyond the Cumberland Gap;",
    "A strange roof is no roof when imps of fear",
    "Pilfer the fatherless in blossom time.",
    "Year in, year out, the daughter tinkered with",
    "The riddle of her birth; the mother chided",
    "The woman Nancy as she had the child,",
    "\u201cHush thee, hush thee, thy father\u2019s a gentleman.\u201d",
    "The butt of bawd, grand jury, Sunday bonnet,",
    "Lucy, driven, taught her daughter the Word,",
    "And Nancy, driven, taught her son the Word,",
    "And Abraham, driven, taught his people the Word!",
    "IV",
    "The man Tom bit his fingernails, then rammed",
    "His pockets with the hector hands that gave",
    "Raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin,",
    "And in his lame speech said: \u201cAunt Peggy, listen,",
    "Now that our Nancy\u2019s time is come, I\u2019m haunted",
    "By my own nothingness. Why breed nobodies?\u201d",
    "He tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot",
    "That aided fist and skull in border fights.",
    "Aunt Peggy counseled: \u201cTom, you say the say",
    "Poor Joseph probably said in that low stable",
    "Ere Jesus came into this mishmash world.\u201d",
    "She paused, then boxed the ears of cynicism:",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true, down in the barnyard, blood speaks loud,",
    "Among the hogs, the chickens, the cows, the horses;",
    "But, when it comes to Man, who knows, who knows",
    "What greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother?\u201d",
    "The man Tom turned and spat: his naked surmise",
    "Ranged out and out. Aunt Peggy\u2019s innermost said:",
    "\u201cYour father Abraham, bred like Daniel Boone,",
    "Conquered a land with gun and ax and plow,",
    "Baptized it in his blood! I say, I\u2019ve said,",
    "What\u2019s in a baby is God Almighty\u2019s business;",
    "How the elders wring it out is worry enough!",
    "The best, the worst\u2014it\u2019s all, all human nature.\u201d",
    "V",
    "The tavern, Tom remembered, the New Year\u2019s Eve,",
    "The clubfoot scholar bagged in Old World clothes,",
    "With arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard.",
    "An Oxford don, he hymned the Bastille\u2019s fall",
    "In spite of the hair-hung sword; his betters set",
    "Him free to hail new truths in new lands, where",
    "He seined with slave and master, knave and priest,",
    "And out of all fished up the rights of man:",
    "\u201cAs Citizen Lincoln asks, \u2018What\u2019s human nature?\u2019",
    "His full mug says a clear mind puts the question",
    "Which ties the fogey scholar in a knot!",
    "My new idea fed to his new baby",
    "Would fetch the New World and the New Year peace!",
    "The sum of anything unriddles the riddle:",
    "The child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all",
    "Grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind.",
    "\u201cTo make a New World and a New Year, Plato",
    "And Jesus begged the boon of little children!",
    "Now Citizen Lincoln asks, \u2018What\u2019s human nature?\u2019",
    "It\u2019s what we elders have: no baby has it.",
    "It\u2019s what our good and bad graft on the neutral.",
    "It\u2019s what our rulers feed the boy and girl.",
    "It\u2019s what society garbs nature in.",
    "It\u2019s a misnomer: call it",
    "VI",
    "Aunt Peggy hovered closer, with flawless rites",
    "Grown lyrical from habit: muffled pain sounds",
    "Dragged from the bed of cleated poles; she hawed",
    "Tom Lincoln, as one turns a nag aside,",
    "Then swooped her way, even as a setting hen",
    "Carves a dictatorship from yard to nest.",
    "And Tom again was squeezed into a cell",
    "Whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess.",
    "Later his memories climbed a gala peak,",
    "His Nancy\u2019s infare that ran riotous:",
    "The bear meat, venison, wild turkey, duck,",
    "The maple sugar hanging for the whiskey,",
    "The red ham, gourds of syrup, bowls of honey,",
    "The wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep,",
    "The guzzling, fiddling, guttling, monkeyshining:",
    "A continent sprawled between that day and this!",
    "A havenot on the frontier is no havenot;",
    "A Crusoe without Friday has no conscience:",
    "Yet Tom\u2019s grub living gnawed him like the teeth",
    "Of slavery, land titles, melancholy.",
    "He, like his forebears, visioned a Promised Land",
    "And tidied ways and means to fly the barrens",
    "That doomed the flesh to peck, to patch, to pinch,",
    "And wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry.",
    "VII",
    "The black ox hours limped by, and day crawled after.",
    "White prongs of ice, like dinosaur fangs, gleamed in",
    "The cavernous mouth of Rock Spring; snowbirds shivered",
    "And chirped rebellion; a cow with jags and gaps",
    "Chewed emptily; hogs squealed in hunger fits;",
    "And scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney,",
    "Which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses",
    "Of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert.",
    "Nancy lay white, serene, like virgin milk",
    "After the udder\u2019s fury in the pail.",
    "Beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe,",
    "In yellow petticoat and linsey shirt,",
    "The baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled\u2014",
    "An anonymity of soft red wrinkles.",
    "Aunt Peggy, hovering, grinned, \u201cHe\u2019s Sabbath-born.",
    "Remember \u2026Sunday\u2014it\u2019s red-letter day!\u201d",
    "Like ax and helve, like scythe and snath, the bond",
    "Held Tom and Nancy; she smiled at his halt smile,",
    "His titan\u2019s muss in picking up the baby.",
    "Tom frowned and spat, then gulped, \u201cHe\u2019s legs! All legs!\u201d",
    "Aunt Peggy beamed, \u201cLong legs can eat up miles.\u201d",
    "Tom gloomed, \u201cThe hands\u2014look at the axman\u2019s hands!\u201d",
    "And Nancy mused, \u201cThe Hankses\u2019 dream, the Lincolns\u2019,",
    "Needs such a man to hew and blaze the way.\u201d"
