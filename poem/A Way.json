    "She said she sang very close to the mike",
    "to change the space. And I changed the space",
    "by striding down the Boulevard Raspail at dusk in tight jeans",
    "until an Algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket.",
    "As if you\u2019re inside my head and you\u2019re hearing the song from in there.",
    "He came from the desert, I came",
    "from green suburbs. We understood",
    "nothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine.",
    "I was playing Girl. He played",
    "Man. Several plots were afoot, all",
    "misfiring. One had to do with my skimpy black shirt",
    "and light hair, his broad shoulders and hunger",
    "after months on an oil rig. Another",
    "was untranslatable. Apollinaire",
    "burned his fingers on June\u2019s smoldering lyre",
    "but I had lost my pen. The engineer",
    "read only construction manuals. His room",
    "was dim and narrow and no,",
    "the story didn\u2019t slide that way though there are many ways",
    "to throw oneself away.",
    "One singer did it by living by a broken wall",
    "until she shredded her voice but still she offered each song,",
    "she said, like an Appalachian artifact.",
    "Like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quay",
    "plastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dolls",
    "through which the current chortles an intimate tune."
