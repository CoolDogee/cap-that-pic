    "Let it come down: these thicknesses of air",
    "have long enough walled love away from love;",
    "stillness has hardened until words despair",
    "of their high leaps and kisses shut themselves",
    "back into wishing. Crippled lovers lie",
    "against a weather which holds out on them,",
    "waiting, awaiting some shrill sign, some cry,",
    "some screaming cat that smells a sacrifice",
    "and spells them thunder. Start the mumbling lips,",
    "syllable by monotonous syllable,",
    "that wash away the sullen griefs of love",
    "and drown out knowledge of an ancient war\u2014",
    "o, ill-willed dark, give with the sound of rain,",
    "let love be brought to ignorance again."
