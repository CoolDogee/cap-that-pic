    "When you see millions of the mouthless dead",
    "Across your dreams in pale battalions go,",
    "Say not soft things as other men have said,",
    "That you'll remember. For you need not so.",
    "Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know",
    "It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?",
    "Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.",
    "Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.",
    "Say only this, \u201cThey are dead.\u201d Then add thereto,",
    "\u201cYet many a better one has died before.\u201d",
    "Then, scanning all the o'ercrowded mass, should you",
    "Perceive one face that you loved heretofore,",
    "It is a spook. None wears the face you knew.",
    "Great death has made all his for evermore."
