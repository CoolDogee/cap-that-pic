    "My head, my heart, mine Eyes, my life, nay more,",

    "to me shalt return,",
    "I wish my Sun may never set, but burn",
    "Within the Cancer of my glowing breast,",
    "The welcome house of him my dearest guest.",
    "Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence,",
    "Till natures sad decree shall call thee hence;",
    "Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone,",
    "I here, thou there, yet both but one."
