    "I want to write, but only foam comes out,",
    "I want to say so much but it\u2019s all crap \u2014",
    "there aren\u2019t any numbers left that can\u2019t be added up,",
    "nobody writes down pyramids without meaning it.",
    "I want to write, but I\u2019ve got a puma\u2019s brains;",
    "I want to crown myself with laurel, but it stinks of onions.",
    "There\u2019s no word spoken that doesn\u2019t dissolve in mist,",
    "there\u2019s no god and no son of god, only progress.",
    "So come on, to hell with it, let\u2019s go eat weeds,",
    "eat the flesh and fruit of our stupid",
    "tears and moans, of our pickled melancholy souls.",
    "Come on! Let\u2019s go! So what if I\u2019m wounded \u2014 let\u2019s go",
    "drink what\u2019s already been drunk,",
    "let\u2019s go, crow, and find another crow to fuck.",
    "Right in front of the Come\u0301die-Franc\u0327aise",
    "is the Regency Cafe; and right inside it, there\u2019s this room, hidden,",
    "with a table and an easy chair. When I go in,",
    "house dust, already on its feet, stands motionless.",
    "Between my lips made of rubber, a cigarette butt",
    "smolders, and in the smoke you can see two intensive",
    "smokes, the cafe\u2019s thorax, and in that",
    "thorax an oxide of elemental grief.",
    "It matters that autumn grafts itself into other autumns,",
    "it matters that autumn merges into young shoots,",
    "the cloud into half-years, cheekbones into a wrinkle.",
    "It\u2019s crucial to smell like a madman who spouts",
    "theories about how hot snow is, how fugitive the turtle,",
    "the \u201chow\u201d how easy, how deadly the \u201cwhen.\u201d",
    "Look, at the very best, I\u2019m someone other \u2014",
    "some guy who walks around marble statues, who enters",
    "his adult clay into indexes of blood, and feels",
    "the rage and fear of the fox chased to its hole \u2014",
    "and if someone anoints my shoulders",
    "with indigos of mercy, I\u2019ll declare",
    "to my absent soul that there\u2019s no hellishly",
    "paradisal elsewhere for me to go.",
    "And if they try to choke me on the sea\u2019s wafer,",
    "telling me it tastes like His flesh, more acid",
    "than sweet, like Kant\u2019s notions of truth, I\u2019ll cough",
    "it all up:",
    "I\u2019m other as a germ, a satanic",
    "tubercle, a moral ache in a plesiosaur\u2019s molar:",
    "in my posthumous suspicions, all bets are off!",
    "I\u2019ll die in my apartment on a cold bright day,",
    "with nobody around, the apartment next door gone",
    "dead still while wind whistles through the balcony,",
    "though the branches somehow aren\u2019t moving, just as the sun",
    "doesn\u2019t move, everything\u2019s so quiet, so frozen.",
    "Parked cars, plastic bags bleached in the bare trees,",
    "a couple of those Mylar balloons tied to a chair on",
    "the balcony next door, celebrating something, maybe?",
    "... now sagging listless on the floor,",
    "as if every last molecule had been pierced by a needle \u2014",
    "Tom Sleigh is dead, he stared up into the air,",
    "the sky was pale blue as usual and he couldn\u2019t feel",
    "the cold coming through the window, and there wasn\u2019t",
    "much to say or not say \u2014 and nobody, anyway, to say or not say it.",
    "My cell\u2019s four walls, whitening in the sun,",
    "keep counting one another \u2014 but their number",
    "never changes, despite my jailer\u2019s",
    "innumerable keys to chains",
    "wrenching the nerves to their extremities.",
    "The two longer walls hurt me more \u2014 who knows why \u2014",
    "their salt-stained cracks like two mothers who die",
    "after labor, but give birth to twin boys",
    "whose hands they still hold. And here I am,",
    "all alone, with just my right hand to make do",
    "for both hands, raising it high into",
    "the air to search for the third arm",
    "that between my where and my when",
    "will father this crippled coming-of-age of a man.",
    "How childish is the spectacle of the stained",
    "glass\u2019s holiness: the night doesn\u2019t give a shit what",
    "goes on inside human beings, the night",
    "has its own web of dendrites refuting the inane",
    "prayers prayed for the dying, for the confessions",
    "going on between earthworms and earth, between",
    "the way a man argues with his own shoulder bones.",
    "All the while, barracudas in a coral canyon,",
    "a sea turtle flying, swim through fathoms",
    "and fathoms of images that keep crashing",
    "on the shore of the eye that never shuts \u2014",
    "and smarts in its sleeplessness staring",
    "up into the dark shadowed by stingrays, gas stations,",
    "the slow flapping wing of a lottery ticket."
