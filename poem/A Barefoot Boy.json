    "A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play\u0097",
    "For May is here once more, and so is he,\u0097",
    "His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,",
    "And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:",
    "Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array",
    "Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me",
    "Of woody pathways winding endlessly",
    "Along the creek, where even yesterday",
    "He plunged his shrinking body\u0097gasped and shook\u0097",
    "Yet called the water \"warm,\" with never lack",
    "Of joy. And so, half enviously I look",
    "Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,\u0097",
    "His toe stubbed\u0097ay, his big toe-nail knocked back",
    "Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook."
