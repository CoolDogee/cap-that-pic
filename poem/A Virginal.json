    "No, no! Go from me. I have left her lately.",
    "I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness,",
    "For my surrounding air hath a new lightness;",
    "Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly",
    "And left me cloaked as with a gauze of \u00e6ther;",
    "As with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness.",
    "Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness",
    "To sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her.",
    "No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour,",
    "Soft as spring wind that\u2019s come from birchen bowers.",
    "Green come the shoots, aye April in the branches,",
    "As winter\u2019s wound with her sleight hand she staunches,",
    "Hath of the trees a likeness of the savour:",
    "As white their bark, so white this lady\u2019s hours."
