    "\u2013Bill Holm",
    "The message that\u2019s recorded on the phone",
    "is unmistakably bad news, and then",
    "another call tells us it\u2019s one we love\u2014",
    "a sudden death while traveling, somehow",
    "appropriate for one who always",
    "seized life too completely to stand still.",
    "A door slams shut, a wall has dropped away,",
    "and once again I\u2019m driven back to",
    "empty pages, insufficient words,",
    "to rooms he always filled on entering\u2014",
    "rooms lined with books, piano music, and",
    "good friends who raise their glasses one last time.",
    "And now, as all the lights are blinking off",
    "in every prairie town we\u2019ve ever loved,",
    "when all the toasts are made and songs are sung,",
    "when leaving is the only certainty,",
    "a single voice keeps echoing, along",
    "each dark, untraveled hallway of the heart."
