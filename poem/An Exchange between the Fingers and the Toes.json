    "Lacking a knuckle you have sadly missed",

    "And only by the curling of that joint",

    "You cannot punch or demonstrate or hold",
    "And therefore cannot write or pluck or mould:",
    "Indeed, it seems deficiency in art",
    "Alone would prove you the inferior part.",
    "Not so, my friends. Our clumsy innocence",

    "And we it is who save you when you fight",
    "Against the odds: you cannot take to flight.",
    "Despite your fabrications and your cunning,",
    "The deepest instinct is expressed in running."
