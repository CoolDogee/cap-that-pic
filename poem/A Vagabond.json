    "A vagabond is a newcomer",
    "in a heap of trouble.",
    "He\u2019s an eyeball at a peephole",
    "that should be electrocuted.",
    "He\u2019s a leper in a textile mill",
    "and likely to be beheaded, I mean,",
    "given a liverwurst sandwich",
    "on the break by the brook",
    "where the loaves are sliced.",
    "But he oughtn\u2019t meddle",
    "with the powder puffs on the golf links\u0097",
    "they have their own goats to tame,",
    "dirigibles to situate.",
    "He can act like an imbecile",
    "if the climate is propitious,",
    "a magnate of kidnap",
    "paradising around the oily depot,",
    "or a speck from a distant nebula",
    "wishing to purchase a certain skyscraper ....",
    "Well, if it\u2019s permitted, then",
    "let\u2019s regulate him, let\u2019s testify",
    "against his thimble, and moderate his gloves",
    "before they sew an apron.",
    "The local minister is thinking",
    "of moving to Holland, exchanging",
    "his old ballads for some lingerie.",
    "\u201cZatso!\u201d says the vagabond.",
    "Homeless, like wheat that tattletales",
    "on the sermon, like wages swigged.",
    "\u201cZatso, zatso, zatso!\u201d cries the vagabond.",
    "The minister reels under the weight",
    "of his thumbs, the vagabond seems to have",
    "jutted into his kernel, disturbed",
    "his terminal core. Slowly, and with",
    "trifling dignity, the minister removes",
    "from his lapel his last campaign button:"
