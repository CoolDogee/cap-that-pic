    "Uncomprising year\u2014I see no meaning to life.",
    "Though this abled self is here nonetheless,",
    "either in trade gold or grammaticness,",
    "I drop the wheelwright\u2019s simple principle\u2014",
    "Why weave the garland? Why ring the bell?",
    "Penurious butchery these notoriously human years,",
    "these confident births these lucid deaths these years.",
    "Dream\u2019s flesh blood reals down life\u2019s mystery\u2014",
    "there is no mystery.",
    "Cold history knows no dynastic Atlantis.",
    "The habitual myth has an eagerness to quit.",
    "No meaning to life can be found in this holy language",
    "nor beyond the lyrical fabricator\u2019s inescapable theme",
    "be found the loathed find\u2014there is nothing to find.",
    "Multitudinous deathplot! O this poor synod\u2014",
    "Hopers and seekers paroling meaning to meaning,",
    "annexing what might be meaningful, what might be meaningless.",
    "Repeated nightmare, lachrymae lachrymae\u2014",
    "a fire behind a grotto, a thick fog, shredded masts,",
    "the nets heaved\u2014and the indescribable monster netted.",
    "Who was it told that red flesh hose be still?",
    "For one with smooth hands did with pincers",
    "snip the snout\u2014It died like a yawn.",
    "And when the liver sack was yanked",
    "I could not follow it to the pan.",
    "I could not follow it to the pan\u2014",
    "I woke to the reality of cars; Oh",
    "the dreadful privilege of that vision!",
    "Not one antique faction remained;",
    "Egypt, Rome, Greece,",
    "and all such pedigree dreams fled.",
    "Cars are real! Eternity is done.",
    "The threat of Nothingness renews.",
    "I touch the untouched.",
    "I rank the rose militant.",
    "Deny, I deny the tastes and habits of the age.",
    "I am its punk debauche .... A fierce lampoon",
    "seeking to inherit what is necessary to forfeit.",
    "Lies! Lies! Lies! I lie, you lie, we all lie!",
    "There is no us, there is no world, there is no universe,",
    "there is no life, no death, no nothing\u2014all is meaningless,",
    "and this too is a lie\u2014O damned 1959!",
    "Must I dry my inspiration in this sad concept?",
    "Delineate my entire stratagem?",
    "Must I settle into phantomness",
    "and not say I understand things better than God?"
