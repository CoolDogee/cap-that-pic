    "As dawn breaks he enters",
    "A room with the odor of acid.",
    "He lays the copper plate on the table.",
    "And reaches for the shaft of the burin.",
    "Dublin wakes to horses and rain.",
    "Street hawkers call.",
    "All the news is famine and famine.",
    "The flat graver, the round graver,",
    "The angle tint tool wait for him.",
    "He bends to his work and begins.",
    "He starts with the head, cutting in",
    "To the line of the cheek, finding",
    "The slope of the skull, incising",
    "The shape of a face that becomes",
    "A foundry of shadows, rendering \u2014",
    "With a deeper cut into copper \u2014",
    "The whole woman as a skeleton,",
    "The rags of her skirt, her wrist",
    "In a bony line forever",
    "severing",
    "Her body from its native air until",
    "She is ready for the page,",
    "For the street vendor, for",
    "A new inventory which now",
    "To loss and to",
    "adds",
    "The odor of acid and the little,",
    "Pitiless tragedy of being imagined.",
    "He puts his tools away,",
    "One by one; lays them out carefully",
    "On the deal table, his work done."
