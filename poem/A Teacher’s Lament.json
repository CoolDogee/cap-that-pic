    "Don\u2019t tell me the cat ate your math sheet,",
    "And your spelling words went down the drain,",
    "And you couldn\u2019t decipher your homework,",
    "Because it was soaked in the rain.",
    "Don\u2019t tell me you slaved for hours",
    "On the project that\u2019s due today,",
    "And you would have had it finished",
    "If your snake hadn\u2019t run away.",
    "Don\u2019t tell me you lost your eraser,",
    "And your worksheets and pencils, too,",
    "And your papers are stuck together",
    "With a great big glob of glue.",
    "I\u2019m tired of all your excuses;",
    "They are really a terrible bore.",
    "Besides, I forgot my own work,",
    "At home in my study drawer."
