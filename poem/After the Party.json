    "Sugar dries on paper plates. The cake\u2019s",

    "to a bottle\u2019s pinch. It\u2019s too late, or too early.",
    "There are too many on the floor, stirred up",
    "as I stir. In the end, I cut them, urge a blade",
    "into the inch between knot and blossom.",
    "Slow deflation. It reveals what they are:",
    "sacs of plastic, stale with air. I\u2019ve seen this",
    "before, in the newspaper picture of Nefertiti,",
    "bound in the antechamber of a tomb,",
    "cast out of favor, her body, barely wrapped.",
    "How they know her: by the queenly jaw,",
    "age of limbs and teeth. Also, by the broken",
    "mouth, smashed by priests so she cannot",
    "eat, cannot breathe in the afterlife."
