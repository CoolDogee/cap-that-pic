    "Courage, my Soul, now learn to wield",
    "The weight of thine immortal shield.",
    "Close on thy head thy helmet bright.",
    "Balance thy sword against the fight.",
    "See where an army, strong as fair,",
    "With silken banners spreads the air.",
    "Now, if thou be\u2019st that thing divine,",
    "In this day\u2019s combat let it shine:",
    "And show that Nature wants an art",
    "To conquer one resolv\u00e8d heart.",
    "Welcome the creation\u2019s guest,",
    "Lord of earth, and heaven\u2019s heir.",
    "Lay aside that warlike crest,",
    "And of Nature\u2019s banquet share:",
    "Where the souls of fruits and flowers",
    "Stand prepared to heighten yours.",
    "I sup above, and cannot stay",
    "To bait so long upon the way.",
    "On these downy pillows lie,",
    "Whose soft plumes will thither fly:",
    "On these roses strewed so plain",
    "Lest one leaf thy side should strain.",
    "My gentler rest is on a thought,",
    "Conscious of doing what I ought.",
    "If thou be\u2019st with perfumes pleased,",
    "Such as oft the gods appeased,",
    "Thou in fragrant clouds shalt show",
    "Like another god below.",
    "A soul that knows not to presume",
    "Is heaven\u2019s and its own perfume.",
    "Everything does seem to vie",
    "Which should first attract thine eye:",
    "But since none deserves that grace,",
    "In this crystal view",
    "face.",
    "When the Creator\u2019s skill is prized,",
    "The rest is all but earth disguised.",
    "Hark how music then prepares",
    "For thy stay these charming airs;",
    "Which the posting winds recall,",
    "And suspend the river\u2019s fall.",
    "Had I but any time to lose,",
    "On this I would it all dispose.",
    "Cease, tempter. None can chain a mind",
    "Whom this sweet chordage cannot bind.",
    "Earth cannot show so brave a sight",
    "As when a single soul does fence",
    "The batteries of alluring sense,",
    "And heaven views it with delight.",
    "Then persevere: for still new charges sound:",
    "And if thou overcom\u2019st, thou shalt be crowned.",
    "All this fair, and soft, and sweet,",
    "Which scatteringly doth shine,",
    "Shall within one beauty meet,",
    "And she be only thine.",
    "If things of sight such heavens be,",
    "What heavens are those we cannot see?",
    "Wheresoe\u2019er thy foot shall go",
    "The minted gold shall lie,",
    "Till thou purchase all below,",
    "And want new worlds to buy.",
    "Were\u2019t not a price, who\u2019d value gold?",
    "And that\u2019s worth naught that can be sold.",
    "Wilt thou all the glory have",
    "That war or peace commend?",
    "Half the world shall be thy slave",
    "The other half thy friend.",
    "What friends, if to my self untrue!",
    "What slaves, unless I captive you!",
    "Thou shalt know each hidden cause;",
    "And see the future time:",
    "Try what depth the centre draws;",
    "And then to heaven climb.",
    "None thither mounts by the degree",
    "Of knowledge, but humility.",
    "Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul;",
    "The world has not one pleasure more:",
    "The rest does lie beyond the Pole,",
    "And is thine everlasting store."
