    "The only time I\u2019ve been to Switzerland",
    "was early one spring on a train through the mountains.",
    "There was a lake\u2014I guess it was Lucerne?",
    "Above me cliff tops ridged with snow fanned out",
    "so that where I stood at the edge of the platform",
    "light bathed the empty siding all around",
    "with a diffused opalescence off the water.",
    "Behind the station must have been a town,",
    "spires of churches, municipal arcades,",
    "and coffee squelching in the fogged caf",
    "I never saw the place, though I remember",
    "thinking",
    "is Switzerland and took",
    "a mind-shot of the pines, breathing in the cold",
    "as the porter whistled at us to reboard."
