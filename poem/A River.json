    "and you can feel it in your warbler neck,",
    "your river-quick high stick wrist",
    "at the end of day. But the trophies:",
    "a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle,",
    "a magpie dipping her wing tips",
    "in a white cloud, an ouzel barreling",
    "hip-high upstream with a warning.",
    "You wish you had a river. To make",
    "a river, it takes some mountains.",
    "Some rain to watershed. You wish",
    "you had a steady meadow and pink thistles",
    "bobbing at the border for your horizons,",
    "pale robins bouncing their good postures",
    "in the spruce shadows. Instead, the law",
    "of life comes for you like three men",
    "and a car. In your dreams, you win them over",
    "with your dreams: a goldfinch tearing up",
    "a pink thistle. A magpie so slow",
    "she knows how to keep death at bay,",
    "she takes her time with argument",
    "and hides her royal blue in black.",
    "Shy as a blue grouse, nevertheless God",
    "doesn\u2019t forget his green mountains.",
    "You wish you had a river."
