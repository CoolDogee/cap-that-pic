    "A quarter of a century",
    "since we left high school,",
    "and we\u2019ve gathered at a posh restaurant.",
    "A little heavier, a little grayer,",
    "we look for the yearbook pictures",
    "caught inside these bodies of strangers.",
    "Some of our faces are etched with lines,",
    "the faint tracing of a lover\u2019s touch,",
    "and some of our hair is silver-white,",
    "a breath of frost. And some of us are gone.",
    "But he\u2019s here, the dark angel,",
    "everyone\u2019s last lover, up at the microphone",
    "singing",
    ";",
    "he\u2019s singing a cappella, the notes rising",
    "sweetly, yearningly toward the ceiling,",
    "which is now festooned with tissue flowers,",
    "paper streamers, balloons.",
    "And we\u2019re all eighteen again,",
    "lines and wrinkles erased, gray hairs gone,",
    "our slim bodies back, the perfect editing.",
    "A saxophone keens its reedy insistence;",
    "scents of gardenias and tea roses float in the air",
    "from our wrist corsages and boutonnieres.",
    "No children or lovers have broken our hearts,",
    "it\u2019s just all of us, together,",
    "in our fresh young skin,",
    "ready to do it all over again."
