    "Penelope for her Ulisses sake,",

    "In which the worke that she all day did make",
    "The same at night she did again unreave:",
    "Such subtile craft my Damzell doth conceave,",
    "Th\u2019 importune suit of my desire to shnone:",
    "For all that I in many dayes doo weave,",
    "In one short houre I find by her undonne.",
    "So when I thinke to end that I begonne,",
    "I must begin and never bring to end:",
    "For with one looke she spils that long I sponne,",
    "And with one word my whole years work doth rend.",
    "Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd,",
    "Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd."
