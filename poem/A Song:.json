    "Strephon, your breach of faith and trust",
    "Affords me no surprise;",

    "That heart to you so fondly tied,",
    "With pleasure wore its chain,",
    "But from your cold neglectful pride,",
    "Found liberty again.",
    "For this no wrath inflames my mind,",
    "My thanks are due to thee;",
    "Such thanks as gen'rous victors find,",
    "Who set their captives free."
