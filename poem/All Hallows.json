    "Even now this landscape is assembling.",
    "The hills darken. The oxen",
    "sleep in their blue yoke,",
    "the fields having been",
    "picked clean, the sheaves",
    "bound evenly and piled at the roadside",
    "among cinquefoil, as the toothed moon rises:",
    "This is the barrenness",
    "of harvest or pestilence.",
    "And the wife leaning out the window",
    "with her hand extended, as in payment,",
    "and the seeds",
    "distinct, gold, calling",
    "Come here, little one",
    "And the soul creeps out of the tree."
