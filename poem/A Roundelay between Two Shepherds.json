    "Tell me, thou gentle shepherd swain,",
    "Who\u2019s yonder in the vale is set?",
    "Oh, it is she, whose sweets do stain",
    "The lily, rose, the violet!",
    "Why doth the sun against his kind,",
    "Fix his bright chariot in the skies?",
    "Because the sun is stricken blind",
    "With looking on her heavenly eyes.",
    "Why do thy flocks forbear their food,",
    "Which sometime were thy chief delight?",
    "Because they need no other good",
    "That live in presence of her sight.",
    "Why look these flowers so pale and ill,",
    "That once attired this goodly heath?",
    "She hath robb\u2019d Nature of her skill,",
    "And sweetens all things with her breath.",
    "Why slide these brooks so slow away,",
    "Whose bubbling murmur pleased thine ear?",
    "Oh, marvel not although they stay,",
    "When they her heavenly voice do hear!",
    "From whence come all these shepherd swains,",
    "And lovely nymphs attired in green?",
    "From gathering garlands on the plains,",
    "To crown our fair the shepherds\u2019 queen.",
    "The sun that lights this world below,",
    "Flocks, flowers, and brooks will witness bear:",
    "These nymphs and shepherds all do know,",
    "That it is she is only fair."
