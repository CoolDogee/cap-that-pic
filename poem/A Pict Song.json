    "Rome never looks where she treads.",

    "Her sentries pass on\u2014that is all,",
    "And we gather behind them in hordes,",
    "And plot to reconquer the Wall,",
    "With only our tongues for our swords.",
    "We are the Little Folk\u2014we!",
    "Too little to love or to hate.",
    "Leave us alone and you\u2019ll see",

    "Watch, and you\u2019ll see it some day!",
    "No indeed! We are not strong,",
    "But we know Peoples that are.",
    "Yes, and we\u2019ll guide them along",
    "To smash and destroy you in War!",
    "shall be slaves just the same?",
    "Yes, we have always been slaves,",
    "But you\u2014you will die of the shame,",
    "And then we shall dance on your graves!"
