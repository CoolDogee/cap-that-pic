    "That which installs itself in the mind embraces sound",
    "Rebounding,",
    "rounding the fecund earth",
    "Birth, as in what is not, as in one makes one,",
    "is a mighty absence to understand",
    "(and there are those who fail to get their lessons done)",
    "Dun is the color of submission",
    "Unfledged, she leafs through what has been nothing never",
    "Never to be what she is/ or could /or hope to be",
    "Bewitched by dictions (fictions) on the surface",
    "Face naming that which she must save, polished like an apple",
    "Apple of the eye,",
    "of town and street, apple of the cheek",
    "Eaten with a dab of honey for a sweet year",
    "Ear to",
    "in the suddenly-arriving",
    "Next to being, next to delivery, next to undergone",
    "Gone parenthetical but now revived as her eye",
    "Spies the sudden trespass of his unexpected welcome",
    "Succumbing, coming unto him in full sun this morning",
    "Mourning what she need not beguile or lie beside"
