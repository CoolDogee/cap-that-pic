    "Once Phidias stood, with hammer in his hand,",
    "Carving Minerva from the breathing stone,",
    "Tracing with love the winding of a hair,",
    "A single hair upon her head, whereon",
    "A youth of Athens cried, \u201cO Phidias,",
    "Why do you dally on a hidden hair?",
    "When she is lifted to the lofty front",
    "Of the Parthenon, no human eye will see.\u201d",
    "And Phidias thundered on him: \u201cSilence, slave:",
    "Men will not see, but the Immortals will!\u201d"
