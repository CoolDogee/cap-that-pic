    "White flabbiness goes brown and lean,",
    "Dumpling arms are now brass bars,",
    "They\u2019ve learnt to suffer and live clean,",
    "And to think below the stars.",
    "They\u2019ve steeled a tender, girlish heart,",
    "Tempered it with a man\u2019s pride,",
    "Learning to play the butcher\u2019s part",
    "Though the woman screams inside\u2014",
    "Learning to leap the parapet,",
    "Face the open rush, and then",
    "To stab with the stark bayonet,",
    "Side by side with fighting men.",
    "On Achi Baba\u2019s rock their bones",
    "Whiten, and on Flanders\u2019 plain,",
    "But of their travailings and groans",
    "Poetry is born again."
