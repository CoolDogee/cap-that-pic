    "Oh, woman, woman in thy brightest hour",
    "Of conscious worth, of pride, of conscious power",

    "That well befits a lovely woman\u2019s heart!",
    "Dare to be good, as thou canst dare be great;",
    "Despise the taunts of envy, scorn and hate;",

    "That of one blood, the nations he has made.",
    "Oh, christian woman, in a christian land,",
    "Canst thou unblushing read this great command?",
    "Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heart",
    "To draw one throb of pity on thy part;",
    "Our \u2018skins may differ,\u2019 but from thee we claim",
    "A sister\u2019s privilege, in a sister\u2019s name.",
    "Oh, woman! \u2013 though upon thy fairer brow",
    "The hues of roses and of lilies grow\u2014",
    "These soon must wither in their kindred earth,",
    "From whence the fair and dark have equal birth.",
    "Let a bright halo o\u2019er thy virtues shed",
    "A lustre, that shall live when thou art dead;",
    "Let coming ages learn to bless they name",
    "Upon the altar of immortal fame."
