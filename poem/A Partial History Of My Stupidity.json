    "Traffic was heavy coming off the bridge,",
    "and I took the road to the right, the wrong one,",
    "and got stuck in the car for hours.",
    "Most nights I rushed out into the evening",
    "without paying attention to the trees,",
    "whose names I didn't know,",
    "or the birds, which flew heedlessly on.",
    "I couldn't relinquish my desires",
    "or accept them, and so I strolled along",
    "like a tiger that wanted to spring",
    "but was still afraid of the wildness within.",
    "The iron bars seemed invisible to others,",
    "but I carried a cage around inside me.",
    "I cared too much what other people thought",
    "and made remarks I shouldn't have made.",
    "I was silent when I should have spoken.",
    "Forgive me, philosophers,",
    "I read the Stoics but never understood them.",
    "I felt that I was living the wrong life,",
    "spiritually speaking,",
    "while halfway around the world",
    "thousands of people were being slaughtered,",
    "some of them by my countrymen.",
    "So I walked on\u2014distracted, lost in thought\u2014",
    "and forgot to attend to those who suffered",
    "far away, nearby.",
    "Forgive me, faith, for never having any.",
    "I did not believe in God,",
    "who eluded me."
