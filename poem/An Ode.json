    "The merchant, to secure his treasure,",
    "Conveys it in a borrowed name;",
    "Euphelia serves to grace my measure,",
    "But Cloe is my real flame.",
    "My softest verse, my darling lyre,",
    "Upon Euphelia\u2019s toilet lay;",
    "When Cloe noted her desire",
    "That I should sing, that I should play.",
    "My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,",
    "But with my numbers mix my sighs;",
    "And whilst I sing Euphelia\u2019s praise,",
    "I fix my soul on Cloe\u2019s eyes.",
    "Fair Cloe blushed; Euphelia frowned;",
    "I sung and gazed; I played and trembled;",
    "And Venus to the Loves around",
    "Remarked how ill we all dissembled."
