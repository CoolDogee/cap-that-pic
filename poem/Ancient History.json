    "Adam, a brown old vulture in the rain,",
    "Shivered below his wind-whipped olive-trees;",
    "Huddling sharp chin on scarred and scraggy knees,",
    "He moaned and mumbled to his darkening brain;",
    "\u2018A lion laired in the hills, that none could tire;",
    "\u2018Swift as a stag; a stallion of the plain,",
    "\u2018Hungry and fierce with deeds of huge desire.\u2019",
    "Grimly he thought of Abel, soft and fair\u2014",
    "A lover with disaster in his face,",
    "And scarlet blossom twisted in bright hair.",
    "\u2018Afraid to fight; was murder more disgrace? ...",
    "... He bowed his head\u2014",
    "The gaunt wild man whose lovely sons were dead."
