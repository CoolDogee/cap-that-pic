    "The one cashier is dozing\u2014",
    "head nodding, slack mouth open,",
    "above the cover girl spread out before her on the counter",
    "smiling up",
    "with indiscriminate forgiveness",
    "and compassion for everyone",
    "who isn\u2019t her.",
    "Only the edge",
    "is visible of the tightly spooled",
    "white miles",
    "of what is soon",
    "to be the torn off",
    "inch by inch receipts,",
    "and the beam of green light in the black glass",
    "of the self scanner",
    "drifts free in the space that is the sum",
    "of the cost of all the items that tonight",
    "won\u2019t cross its path.",
    "Registers of feeling too precise",
    "too intricate to feel",
    "except in the disintegrating",
    "traces of a dream\u2014",
    "panopticon of cameras",
    "cutting in timed procession",
    "from aisle to aisle",
    "to aisle on the overhead screens",
    "above the carts asleep inside each other\u2014",
    "above the darkened",
    "service desk, the pharmacy, the nursery,",
    "so everywhere inside the store",
    "is everywhere at once",
    "no matter where\u2014",
    "eternal reruns",
    "of stray wisps of steam",
    "that rise",
    "from the brightly frozen,",
    "of the canned goods and food stuffs",
    "stacked in columns onto columns",
    "under columns pushed together",
    "into walls of shelves",
    "of aisles all celestially effacing",
    "any trace",
    "of bodies that have picked",
    "packed unpacked and placed",
    "them just so",
    "so as to draw bodies to the",
    "pyramid of plums,",
    "the ziggurats",
    "of apples and peaches and",
    "in the bins the nearly infinite",
    "gradations and degrees of greens",
    "misted and sparkling.",
    "A paradise of absence,",
    "the dreamed of freed",
    "from the dreamer, bodiless",
    "quenchings and consummations",
    "that tomorrow will draw the dreamer",
    "the way it draws the night tonight",
    "to press the giant black moth",
    "of itself against the windows",
    "of fluorescent blazing."
