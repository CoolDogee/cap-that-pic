    "After the news, the forecaster crowed",
    "With excitement about his bad tidings:",
    "Eighteen inches of snow! Take cover!",
    "A little shiver ran through the community.",
    "Children abandoned their homework.",
    "Who cared about the hypotenuse now?",
    "The snowplow driver laid out his long johns.",
    "The old couple, who\u2019d barked at each other",
    "At supper, smiled shyly, turned off the TV,",
    "And climbed the stairs to their queen-size bed",
    "Heaped high with blankets and quilts.",
    "And the aging husky they failed to hear",
    "Scratch the back door, turned around twice",
    "In the yard, settled herself in the snow,",
    "And covered her nose with her tail."
