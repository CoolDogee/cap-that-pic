    "the thief has made me a gift of his night\u2019s booty",
    "somewhere, a daughter discovers her mother\u2019s coral",
    "brooch missing, somewhere, a man recoils at the absence",
    "of his gambling stash. somewhere, a miser rifles",
    "over a vanished ransom in newly minted silver",
    "all this to buy a hotbed of memories",
    "to feed the children fresh-killed lies",
    "to open all the locks on love",
    "forever is a moment we hold in our stomachs",
    "as he brushes the smudge of his kiss",
    "across my lips, i smell the cologne of his fear",
    "a robust and smoky aroma mingled",
    "with the woody musk of courtrooms and the stench of",
    "pain-paved alleyways",
    "i take these things and promise to say mum"
