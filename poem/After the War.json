    "After the war perhaps I'll sit again",
    "Out on the terrace where I sat with you,",
    "And see the changeless sky and hills beat blue",
    "And live an afternoon of summer through.",
    "I shall remember then, and sad at heart",
    "For the lost day of happiness we knew,",
    "Wish only that some other man were you",
    "And spoke my name as once you used to do."
