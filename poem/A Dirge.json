    "Why were you born when the snow was falling?",
    "You should have come to the cuckoo\u2019s calling,",
    "Or when grapes are green in the cluster,",
    "Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster",
    "For their far off flying",
    "From summer dying.",
    "Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?",
    "You should have died at the apples\u2019 dropping,",
    "When the grasshopper comes to trouble,",
    "And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,",
    "And all winds go sighing",
    "For sweet things dying."
