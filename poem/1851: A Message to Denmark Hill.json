    "it is the year\u2019s First Day,",
    "Yet so like the Last, in Venice, no one",
    "Could tell this birth from the lees.",
    "I know it is some while",
    "Since you received a word of mine: there has been",
    "The shabbiest sort of interruption",
    "To our exchanges (to mine",
    "At least) in the shape",
    "Of a fever\u2014nights of those imaginings,",
    "Strange but shameful too, of the Infinite",
    "By way of bedcovers and",
    "Boa constrictors,",
    "With cold wedges of ice, as I thought, laid down",
    "At the corners of the bed, making me",
    "Slip to its coiling center",
    "Where I could not breathe.",
    "You knew from my last, I think, I had again",
    "Gone to the Zoological Gardens",
    "And seen the great boa take",
    "Rabbits, which gave me",
    "An idea or two, and a headache. Then",
    "I had too much wine that same night, & dreamed",
    "Of a walk with Nurse, to whom",
    "I showed a lovely",
    "Snake I promised her was an innocent one:",
    "It had a slender neck with a green ring",
    "Round it, and I made her feel",
    "The scales. When she bade",
    "Me feel them too, it turned to a fat thing, like",
    "A leech, and adhered to my hand, so that",
    "I could scarcely pull it off\u2014",
    "And I awakened",
    "(So much, father, for my serpentine fancies)",
    "To a vermillion dawn, fever fallen,",
    "And the sea horizon dark,",
    "Sharp and blue, and far",
    "Beyond it, faint with trebled distance, came on",
    "The red vertical cliffs in a tremor",
    "Of light I could not see without",
    "Recalling Turner",
    "Who had taught me so to see it, yet the whole",
    "Subdued to one soft gray. And that morning",
    "I had your letter, father,",
    "Telling of the death",
    "Of my earthly master. How much more I feel",
    "This now (perhaps it is worth noting here",
    "The appearance of my first",
    "Gray hair, this morning)",
    "\u2014More than I thought I should: everything",
    "In the sun, in the sky so speaks of him,",
    "So mourns their Great Witness lost.",
    "Today, the weather",
    "Is wretched, cold and rainy, dark like England",
    "At this season. I do begin to lose",
    "All faith in these provinces.",
    "Even the people",
    "Look to me ugly, except children from eight",
    "To fourteen, who here as in Italy",
    "Anywhere are glorious:",
    "So playful and bright",
    "In expression, so beautiful in feature,",
    "So dark in eye and soft in hair\u2014creatures",
    "Quite unrivalled. At fifteen",
    "They degenerate",
    "Into malignant vagabonds, or sensual",
    "Lumps of lounging fat. And this latter-day",
    "Venice, father! where by night",
    "The black gondolas",
    "Are just traceable beside one, as if Cadmus",
    "Had sown the wrong teeth and grown dragons, not",
    "Men. The Grand Canal, this month,",
    "Is all hung, from end",
    "To end, with carpets and tapestries like a street",
    "Of old-clothes warehouses. And now there is",
    "Even talk of taking down,",
    "Soon, Tintoretto\u2019s",
    "to \u201crestore\u201d it. Father, without",
    "The Turner Gallery, I do believe",
    "I should go today and live",
    "In a cave on some",
    "Cliffside\u2014among crows. Oh what fools they are, this",
    "Restoring pack, yet smoothing all manner",
    "Of rottenness up with words.",
    "My Turner would not",
    "like these, and only once in all the years",
    "I knew him said, \u201cThank you, Mr. Ruskin.\u201d",
    "My own power, if it be that,",
    "Would be lost by mere",
    "Fine Writing. You know I promised no Romance\u2014",
    "I promised them Stones. Not even bread.",
    "Father, I do not feel any",
    "Romance in Venice!",
    "Here is no \u201cabiding city,\u201d here is but",
    "A heap of ruins trodden underfoot",
    "By such men as Ezekiel",
    "Angrily describes,",
    "Here are lonely and stagnant canals, bordered",
    "For the most part by blank walls of gardens",
    "(Now waste ground) or by patches",
    "Of mud, with decayed",
    "Black gondolas lying keel-upmost, sinking",
    "Gradually into the putrid soil.",
    "To give Turner\u2019s joy of this",
    "Place would not take ten",
    "Days of study, father, or of residence:",
    "It is more than joy that must be the great",
    "Fact I would teach. I am not sure,",
    "Even, that joy is",
    "A fact. I am certainly only of the strong",
    "Instinct in me (I cannot reason this)",
    "To draw, delimit the things",
    "I love\u2014oh not for",
    "Reputation or the good of others or",
    "My own advantage, but a sort of need,",
    "Like that for water and food.",
    "I should like to draw",
    "All Saint Mark\u2019s, stone by stone, and all this city,",
    "Oppressive and choked with slime as it is",
    "(Effie of course declares, each",
    "Day, that we must leave:",
    "A woman cannot help having no heart, but",
    "That is hardly a reason she should have",
    "No manners), yes, to eat it",
    "All into my mind\u2014",
    "Touch by touch. I have been reading",
    "lately, father. It seems to me",
    "A parallel to Turner\u2019s",
    "Last pictures\u2014the mind",
    "Failing altogether, yet with intervals",
    "And such returns of power! \u201cThereupon",
    "Satan, bowing low his gray",
    "Dissimulation,",
    "Disappeared.\u201d Now he is gone,",
    "dark angel,",
    "And I never had such a conception",
    "Of the way I must mourn\u2014not",
    "What I lose, now, but",
    "What I",
    "lost, until now. Yet there is more",
    "Pain knowing that I must forget it all,",
    "That in a year I shall have",
    "No more",
    "Of his loss than of that fair landscape I saw,",
    "Waking, the morning your letter arrived,",
    "No more left about me than",
    "A fading pigment.",
    "All the present glory, like the present pain,",
    "Is no use to me; it hurts me rather",
    "From my fear of leaving it,",
    "Of losing it, yet",
    "I know that were I to stay here, it would soon",
    "Cease being glory to me\u2014that it",
    "Ceased, already, to produce",
    "The impression and",
    "The delight. I can bear only the first days",
    "At a place, when all the dread of losing",
    "Is lost in the delirium",
    "Of its possession.",
    "I daresay love is very well when it does not",
    "Mean",
    "as it does always,",
    "Somehow, with me. I have not",
    "The heart for more now,",
    "Father, though I thank you and Mother for all",
    "The comfort of your words. They bring me,",
    "With",
    "loss, to what I said",
    "Once, the lines on this",
    "Place you will know: \u201cThe shore lies naked under",
    "The night, pathless, comfortless and infirm",
    "In dark languor, still except",
    "Where salt runlets plash",
    "Into tideless pools, or seabirds flit from their",
    "Margins with a questioning cry.\u201d The light",
    "Is gone from the waters with",
