    "You ignore the way light filters through my cells,",
    "the way I have of fading out\u2014still",
    "there is a constant tug, a stretching,",
    "what is left of me is coming loose. Soon,",
    "I will be only crumbs of popcorn,",
    "a blue ring in the tub, an empty",
    "toilet paper roll, black mold",
    "misted on old sponges,",
    "strands of hair woven into",
    "carpet, a warped door",
    "that won\u2019t open, the soft spot",
    "in an avocado, celery, a pear,",
    "a metallic taste in the beer, a cold sore",
    "on your lip\u2014and when I finally lose my hold",
    "you will hear a rustle and watch me spill",
    "grains of rice across the cracked tile."
