    "his long beak thin and hooked,",
    "waving a bum wing at passing cars.",
    "I was a timid kid, easily spooked. And it seemed like touchy gods",
    "were everywhere\u2014in the horns",
    "and roar of diesels, in thunder, wind, tree limbs thrashing",
    "the windows at night.",
    "I was ashamed to be afraid of my grandfather.",
    "But the hair on his ears!",
    "The cackle in his throat!",
    "Then on his birthday, my mother coaxed me into the yard.",
    "I carried the cake with the one tiny candle",
    "and sat it on a towel in the shade.",
    "I tried not to tremble,",
    "but it felt like gods were everywhere\u2014in the grimy clouds",
    "smothering the pine tops, the chainsaw",
    "in Cantrell\u2019s woods\u2014everywhere, everywhere,",
    "and from the look of the man",
    "in the lawn chair, he\u2019d pissed one off."
