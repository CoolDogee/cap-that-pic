    "Catalpas blooming up and down Catalpa Street, car alarms blooming",
    "up and down Waveland Avenue\u2014an instant of nature without the narrative.",
    "O face-in-your-morning-juice, swimmer-in-an-old-wool-suit,",
    "we sit side by side on the steps smoking the same cigarette,",
    "watching children who live alone, women married to the wrong men.",
    "Here is your little dog roaming the alley. What will he do for love this time?",
    "The gauchos sing: \u201cThe silver lights of stars hurl themselves",
    "against the open pampas of Clark Street\u201d O tomato-in-a-woman\u2019s-palm,",
    "one millisecond following the next millisecond, \u201cHeal thyself,\u201d",
    "the poem says, \u201cPick up your beggar\u2019s mat and walk.\u201d",
    "You hurl yourself into traffic. You talk to cops and street thugs;",
    "they smile at their smartphones. They strut in the sun like jackals",
    "after a kill. And the gauchos sing: \u201cEveryone will finally leave you, fugitive.\u201d",
    "A cloud of pigeons cuts through the smog. Everyone will finally leave you.",
    "When the bus comes we sing like sailors. A red sky presses you to its lips.",
    "I tell you that everything has already been written. You say",
    "on a long, difficult pilgrimage Basho wrote on his hat."
