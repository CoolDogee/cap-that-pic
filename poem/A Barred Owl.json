    "The warping night air having brought the boom",
    "Of an owl\u2019s voice into her darkened room,",
    "We tell the wakened child that all she heard",
    "Was an odd question from a forest bird,",
    "Asking of us, if rightly listened to,",
    "\u201cWho cooks for you?\u201d and then \u201cWho cooks for you?\u201d",
    "Words, which can make our terrors bravely clear,",
    "Can also thus domesticate a fear,",
    "And send a small child back to sleep at night",
    "Not listening for the sound of stealthy flight",
    "Or dreaming of some small thing in a claw",
    "Borne up to some dark branch and eaten raw."
