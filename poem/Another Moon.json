    "of bluebells",

    "spinning so close to the earth",
    "that it bent",
    "every weather vane in Omaha",
    "it was prom night",
    "and I thought I\u2019d pluck a few",
    "trumpets",
    "to bring your Grandma",
    "so I pulled our red ladder out",
    "of the garage",
    "and climbed to the roof",
    "I stood up",
    "and imagined I was balancing",
    "the moon on my head",
    "the narrow windows of Union",
    "Station",
    "gleamed like ice chips",
    "and the thin faces of the clock",
    "tower told me",
    "it was almost eight",
    "I was going to be late picking",
    "Nancy up",
    "if I didn\u2019t get a move on",
    "so I snipped off the best stems",
    "and hurried",
    "back down to my Ford",
    "I sped through every stop sign",
    "on my way",
    "to her parents\u2019 house",
    "she was waiting with her arms",
    "crossed",
    "trying not to look upset",
    "I think she thought",
    "she was going to get stood up",
    "so when I popped open",
    "the door",
    "and told her to get in",
    "she couldn\u2019t help smiling a bit",
    "she asked",
    "what\u2019d taken me so long",
    "and I figured I should go ahead",
    "and give her the flowers",
    "I\u2019d brought her",
    "I\u2019d set them",
    "back behind the steering wheel",
    "to not ruin the surprise",
    "I told her she was the princess",
    "and I was the knight",
    "who rode into the stars",
    "so he could flare",
    "their notes to her on a blue horn"
