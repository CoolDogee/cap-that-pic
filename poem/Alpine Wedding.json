    "All dark morning long the clouds are rising slowly up",
    "beneath us, and we are fast asleep.",
    "The mountains unmove",
    "intensely. And so do we. Meadows",
    "look down.",
    "A city there looks up and",
    "stirs a little. Adrift the rolling tiled roofs of",
    "buildings, the deadly",
    "trains of grinding sand and morning\u2014",
    "a spy unfolds his paper,",
    "the coffee\u2019s served.",
    "A bride and groom stand shivering on a tarmac",
    "in the mist, and",
    "they are happy. Each one",
    "and all of us entangled, the room is moist with us,",
    "the house unfinished, windowless,",
    "and we are fast asleep.",
    "The brother of the groom can\u2019t get",
    "close enough. He leans against the brightest ridge",
    "and ladder, the sucking",
    "sound of memory",
    "as heaven picks up speed and",
    "hurtles through his burning skin",
    "its frozen blankets",
    "to the sun."
