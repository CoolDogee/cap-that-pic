    "Some seventy years later",
    "your father, sitting at your table",
    "over wine he savors, last rays mellow-",
    "ing in it, recalls his favorite aunt,",
    "Rifka.",
    "\u201cJust naming her shoots",
    "rifles off again inside the morning",
    "square, rifles she aimed into the air",
    "for certain customers, the pigeons",
    "erupting.\u201d",
    "Handsome, clever,",
    "but with little actual schooling,",
    "she, a Jewess, kept a shop in Moscow,",
    "stocking horse- and battle-gear,",
    "bustling all day long.",
    "Powders,",
    "braided with his laboring breath,",
    "still prickle inside his nostrils;",
    "like the wayward flickers cast",
    "by lazily swimming,",
    "naked limbs,",
    "leathers polished, buckles, gleam;",
    "and the oats banked in their bins,",
    "heavy August winds drowsed in them,",
    "at one glance, a single sniffing,",
    "bloom;",
    "the harnesses and bells,",
    "by gaslight starred, send out appeals,",
    "while sleighs collect for midnight",
    "junkets.",
    "He smitten with it all,",
    "like those officers of the Czar",
    "who, admiring her wit, her seasoned",
    "gaiety, forever jammed the shop.",
    "\u201cEven the city\u2019s metropolitan,",
    "young despite his full, black robes,",
    "took to dropping in on her, his jagged,",
    "bushy beard awag with chat.",
    "One balmy",
    "summer evening, I remember, the three",
    "of us, laughter brimming like wine",
    "(he turned his glass to the lessened",
    "light), relaxed in her snug flat.",
    "The next morning at breakfast,",
    "talk going on as if we\u2019d never stop\u201d\u2014",
    "he, a startled look lit on his face,",
    "breaking in upon himself, exclaims,",
    "the pigeons crackling through the air\u2014",
    "\u201cMy God, he spent the night with her!\u201d",
    "He, sipping the last drop, sits",
    "back, as much as he\u2019s amazed amused",
    "to see this special virtue of old age,",
    "the oats ripening only in slow time."
