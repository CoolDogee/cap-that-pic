    "Ah the delight of dawn!",
    "Over the grassy lawn",
    "the spark of silk, of silk",
    "spat out by some small spider",
    "to be the breeze's pawn.",
    "A distant siren whines",
    "from the freeway. Sun shines!",
    "What a Sunday, what peace!",
    "An old man's tidy peace,",
    "his favorite hour of all.",
    "The ants march on in rows.",
    "They're off to do who knows",
    "what harm to the ripe pears ...",
    "Such sun now on the wall!",
    "The lizards heed its call."
