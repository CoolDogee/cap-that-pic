    "The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there,",
    "And warmly debated the matter;",
    "The Orthodox said that it came from the air,",
    "And the Heretics said from the platter.",
    "They argued it long and they argued it strong,",
    "And I hear they are arguing now;",
    "But of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese,",
    "Not one of them thought of a cow."
