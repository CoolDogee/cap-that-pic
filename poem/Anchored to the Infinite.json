    "The builder who first bridged Niagara\u2019s gorge,",
    "Before he swung his cable, shore to shore,",
    "Sent out across the gulf his venturing kite",
    "Bearing a slender cord for unseen hands",
    "To grasp upon the further cliff and draw",
    "A greater cord, and then a greater yet;",
    "Till at the last across the chasm swung",
    "The cable then the mighty bridge in air!",
    "So we may send our little timid thought",
    "Across the void, out to God\u2019s reaching hands\u2014",
    "Send out our love and faith to thread the deep\u2014",
    "Thought after thought until the little cord",
    "Has greatened to a chain no chance can break,",
    "And we are anchored to the Infinite!"
