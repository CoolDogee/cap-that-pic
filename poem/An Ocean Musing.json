    "Far, far out lie the white sails all at rest;",
    "Like spectral arms they seem to touch and cling",
    "Unto the wide horizon. Not a wing",
    "Of truant bird glides down the purpling west;",
    "No breeze dares to intrude, e\u2019en on a quest",
    "To fan a lover\u2019s brow; the waves to sing",
    "Have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling",
    "A bow across its vibrant chords. Then, lest",
    "One moment of the sea\u2019s repose we lose,",
    "Nor furnish Fancy with a thousand themes",
    "Of unimagined sweetness, let us gaze",
    "On this serenity, for as we muse,",
    "Lo! all is restless motion: life\u2019s best dreams",
    "Give changing moods to even halcyon days."
