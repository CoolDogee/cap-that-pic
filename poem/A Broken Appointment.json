    "You did not come,",
    "And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,\u2014",
    "Yet less for loss of your dear presence there",
    "Than that I thus found lacking in your make",
    "That high compassion which can overbear",
    "Reluctance for pure lovingkindness\u2019 sake",
    "Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,",
    "You did not come.",
    "You love not me,",
    "And love alone can lend you loyalty;",
    "\u2013I know and knew it. But, unto the store",
    "Of human deeds divine in all but name,",
    "Was it not worth a little hour or more",
    "To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came",
    "To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be",
    "You love not me?"
