    "If one could have that little head of hers",
    "Painted upon a background of pale gold,",
    "Such as the Tuscan\u2019s early art prefers!",
    "No shade encroaching on the matchless mould",
    "Of those two lips, which should be opening soft",
    "In the pure profile; not as when she laughs,",
    "For that spoils all: but rather as if aloft",
    "Yon hyacinth, she loves so, leaned its staff\u2019s",
    "Burthen of honey-coloured buds to kiss",
    "And capture \u2019twixt the lips apart for this.",
    "Then her lithe neck, three fingers might surround,",
    "How it should waver on the pale gold ground,",
    "Up to the fruit-shaped, perfect chin it lifts!",
    "I know, Correggio loves to mass, in rifts",
    "Of heaven, his angel faces, orb on orb",
    "Breaking its outline, burning shades absorb:",
    "But these are only massed there, I should think,",
    "Waiting to see some wonder momently",
    "Grow out, stand full, fade slow against the sky",
    "(That\u2019s the pale ground you\u2019d see this sweet face by),",
    "All heaven, meanwhile, condensed into one eye",
    "Which fears to lose the wonder, should it wink."
