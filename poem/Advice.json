    "You know how, after it rains,",
    "my father told me one August afternoon",
    "when I struggled with something",
    "hurtful my best friend had said,",
    "how worms come out and",
    "crawl all over the sidewalk",
    "and it stays a big mess",
    "a long time after it\u2019s over",
    "if you step on them?",
    "Leave them alone,",
    "he went on to say,",
    "after clearing his throat,",
    "and when the rain stops,",
    "they crawl back into the ground."
