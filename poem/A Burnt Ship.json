    "Out of a fired ship, which by no way",
    "But drowning could be rescued from the flame,",
    "Some men leap'd forth, and ever as they came",
    "Near the foes' ships, did by their shot decay;",
    "So all were lost, which in the ship were found,",
    "They in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drown'd."
