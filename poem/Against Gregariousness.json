    "Facing the wind, the hovering stormy petrels",
    "Tap-dance on the water.",

    "Up near the surface so the diving shearwaters",
    "Can fly down through the bubbles and get at them.",
    "Birds from above and big fish from below",
    "Rip at the pack until it comes apart",
    "Like Poland, with survivors in single figures.",
    "The krill, as singletons almost not there",
    "But",
    "like a cloud of diamond dust",
    "Against the sunlit flood of their ballroom ceiling,",
    "Are scooped up by the basking shark\u2019s dragline",
    "Or sucked in through the whale\u2019s drapes of baleen\u2014",
    "A galaxy absorbed into a boudoir",
    "And nullified, a deep-space mass extinction",
    "Watched only by the Hubble telescope.",

    "A lobster fortified with jutting eaves",
    "Of glazed tile, like the castle at Nagoya",
    "Hoisted around by jacks and cranes, an awkward",
    "Mouthful like a crushed car. That being done,",
    "Crawl backwards down a hole and don\u2019t come out."
