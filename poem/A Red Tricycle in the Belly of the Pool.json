    "the live oak over the nursery got a disease",
    "they could only save one limb",
    "it wasn\u2019t surprising; it wasn\u2019t that kind of nursery",
    "a girl rode her red tricycle around the bottom of the pool",
    "the pool had no water; it hadn\u2019t rained",
    "the girl kept smelling her hand",
    "it smelled like honeywheat, or the inside of a girl\u2019s panties",
    "someone said, race you",
    "she nodded okay and pedaled like hell",
    "after three laps no one had passed her",
    "she looked over her shoulder, lost her balance",
    "ripped her hands & knees on the blue concrete",
    "the one limb on the live oak curved like a question",
    "would she need stitches again",
    "there was already ink under her skin & iodine on her tongue",
    "or was it the other way around",
    "she could see black thread bunching",
    "sewing centipedes under her skin",
    "her throat burned and she couldn\u2019t move her legs",
    "it wasn\u2019t a tricycle",
    "it was something she couldn\u2019t get her foot out from under",
    "she hated to stop or lose her shoe and, I\u2019m sorry",
    "the pool was full of water"
