    "Morning: the caged baby",
    "sustains his fragile sleep.",
    "The house is a husk against weather.",
    "Nothing stirs\u2014inside, outside.",
    "With the leaves fallen,",
    "the tree makes a web on the window",
    "and through it the world",
    "lacks color or texture,",
    "like stones in the pasture",
    "seen from this distance.",
    "This is what is done with pain:",
    "ice on the wound,",
    "the isolating tourniquet\u2014",
    "as though to check an open vein",
    "where the self pumps out of the self",
    "would stop the second movement of the heart,",
    "diastolic, inclusive:",
    "to love is to siphon loss into that chamber.",
    "What does it mean when a woman says,",
    "\u201cmy husband,\u201d",
    "if she sits all day in the tub;",
    "if she worries her life like a dog a rat;",
    "if her husband seems familiar but abstract,",
    "a bandaged hand she\u2019s forgotten how to use.",
    "They\u2019ve reached the middle years.",
    "Spared grief, they are given dread",
    "as they tend the frail on either side of them.",
    "Even their marriage is another child,",
    "grown rude and querulous",
    "since death practiced on them and withdrew.",
    "He asks of her only a little lie,",
    "a pale copy drawn from the inked stone",
    "where they loll beside the unicorn,",
    "great lovers then, two strangers",
    "joined by appetite:",
    "it frightens her,",
    "to live by memory\u2019s poor diminished light.",
    "She wants something crisp and permanent,",
    "like coral\u2014a crown, a trellis,",
    "an iron shawl across the bed",
    "where they are laced together,",
    "the moon bleaching the house,",
    "their bodies abandoned\u2014",
    "In last week\u2019s mail,",
    "still spread on the kitchen table,",
    "the list of endangered species.",
    "How plain the animals are,",
    "quaint, domestic,",
    "but the names lift from the page:",
    "Woundfin. Whooping Crane. Squawfish.",
    "Black-footed Ferret. California Least Tern.",
    "Dearest, the beast of Loch Ness, that shy,",
    "broad-backed, two-headed creature,",
    "may be a pair of whales or manatee,",
    "male and female,",
    "driven from their deep mud nest,",
    "who cling to each other,",
    "circling the surface of the lake."
