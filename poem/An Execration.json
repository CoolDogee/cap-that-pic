    "Given the existence of plagues of eels and bloodsuckers in Lake L\u00e9man,",
    "cursed by the Bishop of Lausanne and the learned doctors of Heidelberg,",
    "the homicidal bees condemned at the Council of Worms, the petition",
    "of the inhabitants of Beaune for a decree of excommunication against certain",
    "noxious insects called hurebers, a kind of locust or harvest fly \u2014",
    "given, further, the trial of the weevils of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne lasting",
    "over eight months, with due attention to the protocol of cases brought",
    "against caterpillars, to the custom of writing letters of advice to rats,",
    "the writs of ejectment served on them, and the rhyming rats of Ireland;",
    "and, further, Egbert, Archbishop of Trier, having previously anathematized",
    "the swallows which disturbed the devotions of the faithful and sacrilegiously",
    "defiled his head and vestments with their droppings, and exulted",
    "in scandalous unchastity during his sermons; in spite of the vermifugal efficacy",
    "of St. Magnus\u2019s crosier and accompanying papal execratories, all sorts",
    "of animals, a cock burned at the stake for the unnatural crime of laying",
    "an egg, an ox decapitated for its demerits, all manner of sweet",
    "and stenchy beasts, are observed to persist in their heretical obduracy,",
    "irrational and imperfect creatures, though notified, admonished and commanded",
    "to depart from the habitations of man, notices to this effect being posted",
    "on trees that all guilty parties may read; and whereas it has been",
    "urged that brute beasts that they are, the field mouse, locust, mole,",
    "ass, mule, mare, goat, snail, slug, weevil, turtledove, pig, cow and bull,",
    "are lacking immortal souls (that they might be damned), they lack not",
    "indwelling spirits, otherwise demons and imps of Satan, of which",
    "they are the visible form, so that it is the demon and not the beast",
    "that suffers in the beaten dog and squeals in the butchered pig;",
    "a vile and lowly specimen of which genus art thou, the accused,",
    "standing trotters against the dock before me now, that did willfully",
    "last Tuesday fortnight throw the swineherd\u2019s son to the ground,",
    "mangling his ears and cheeks, for which crime having first been dressed",
    "in a velveteen waistcoat as is our custom and the executioner furnished",
    "with a fresh pair of gloves, you will be conveyed to the town square",
    "and there without benefit of clergy be hanged by the neck until dead",
    "and your body thereafter displayed for the improvement of your fellow",
    "filth-dwelling sinners. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
