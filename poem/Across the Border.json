    "Where all the trees bear golden flowers,",

    "But no man understand",
    "Save one whose child-feet chanced to walk",
    "Green paths of fairyland;",
    "I followed two swift silver wings;",
    "I stalked a roving song;",
    "I startled shining, silent things;",
    "I wandered all day long.",
    "But when it seemed the shadowy hours",
    "Whispered of soft-foot night,",
    "I crept home to sweet common flowers,",
    "Brown birds, and candlelight."
