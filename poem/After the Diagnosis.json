    "No remembering now",
    "when the apple sapling was blown",
    "almost out of the ground.",
    "No telling how,",
    "with all the other trees around,",
    "it alone was struck.",
    "It must have been luck,",
    "he thought for years, so close",
    "to the house it grew.",
    "It must have been night.",
    "Change is a thing one sleeps through",
    "when young, and he was young.",
    "If there was a weakness in the earth,",
    "a give he went down on his knees",
    "to find and feel the limits of,",
    "there is no longer.",
    "If there was one random blow from above",
    "the way he's come to know",
    "from years in this place,",
    "the roots were stronger.",
    "Whatever the case,",
    "he has watched this tree survive",
    "wind ripping at his roof for nights",
    "on end, heats and blights",
    "that left little else alive.",
    "No remembering now...",
    "A day's changes mean all to him",
    "and all days come down",
    "to one clear pane",
    "through which he sees",
    "among all the other trees",
    "this leaning, clenched, unyielding one",
    "that seems cast",
    "in the form of a blast",
    "that would have killed it,",
    "as if something at the heart of things,",
    "and with the heart of things,",
    "had willed it."
