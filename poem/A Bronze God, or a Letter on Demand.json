    "I like to think of your silence as the love letters you will not write me,",
    "as two sax solos from two ages across a stage, learning the languages",
    "of kissing with your eyes closed. I like to think of you as a god",
    "to whom I no longer pray, as a god I aspire to. I like the opening of your joined palms,",
    "which is like an urn where my ashes find a home. The music of your lashes;",
    "the silent way your body wears out mine.",
    "Mostly, I like to think of you at night when a black screen of shining dust shines",
    "from your mines to the edge of my skin, where you are a lamp of flutters.",
    "I remember the spectral lashes\u2013marigold, tamarind, secret thing between your thighs,",
    "of closed kissing eyes. At night, the possibility of you is a heavy",
    "sculpture of heavy bronze at the side of my bed,",
    "a god. And I pray you into life. Into flesh."
