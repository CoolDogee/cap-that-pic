    "Keep away, son, these lakes are salt. These flowers",
    "Eat insects. Here private lunatics",
    "Yell and skip in a very dry country.",
    "Or where some haywire monument",
    "Some badfaced daddy of fear",
    "Commands an unintelligent rite.",
    "To dance on the unlucky mountain,",
    "To dance they go, and shake the sin",
    "Out of their feet and hands,",
    "Frenzied until the sudden night",
    "Falls very quiet, and magic sin",
    "Creeps, secret, back again.",
    "Badlands echo with omens of ruin:",
    "Seven are very satisfied, regaining possession:",
    "(Bring a little mescaline, you\u2019ll get along!)",
    "There\u2019s something in your bones,",
    "There\u2019s someone dirty in your critical skin,",
    "There\u2019s a tradition in your cruel misdirected finger",
    "Which you must obey, and scribble in the hot sand:",
    "\u201cLet everybody come and attend",
    "Where lights and airs are fixed",
    "To teach and entertain. O watch the sandy people",
    "Hopping in the naked bull\u2019s-eye,",
    "Shake the wildness out of their limbs,",
    "Try to make peace like John in skins",
    "Elijah in the timid air",
    "or Anthony in tombs:",
    "Pluck the imaginary trigger, brothers.",
    "Shoot the devil: he\u2019ll be back again!\u201d",
    "America needs these fatal friends",
    "Of God and country, to grovel in mystical ashes,",
    "Pretty big prophets whose words don\u2019t burn,",
    "Fighting the strenuous imago all day long.",
    "Only these lunatics, (O happy chance)",
    "Only these are sent. Only this anaemic thunder",
    "Grumbles on the salt flats, in rainless night:",
    "O go home, brother, go home!",
    "The devil\u2019s back again,",
    "And magic Hell is swallowing flies."
