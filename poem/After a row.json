    "A lapwing somersaults spring",

    "After a fast walk up long hills, my limbs",

    "bubbles into beck and clough to gill,",
    "beneath a sandstone cliff balanced on a bed of shale",
    "and held from hurtling by Scots pine",
    "that brush a scrubby sky with cloud snow scutters,",
    "I found a place to sit",
    "by snapping watta smacking rocks",
    "and wondered \u2014 how would it be for you?",
    "And so, alone,",
    "un-alone even, in my anger,",
    "bring you here."
