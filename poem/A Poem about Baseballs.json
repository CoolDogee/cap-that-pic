    "for years the scenes bustled",
    "through him as he dreamed he was",
    "alive. then he felt real, and slammed",
    "awake in the wet sheets screaming",
    "too fast, and the edges of things",
    "are gone. four blocks away",
    "a baseball was a dot against",
    "the sky, and he thought, my",
    "glove is too big, i will",
    "drop the ball and it will be",
    "a home run.",
    "too fast from the clouds,",
    "and night is dropped and",
    "snatched back like a huge",
    "joke. is that the ball, or is",
    "it just a bird, and the ball is",
    "somewhere else, and i will",
    "miss it?",
    "hands melt into the walls, my",
    "hands do not end where the wall",
    "begins. should i move",
    "forward, or back, or will the ball",
    "come right to me? i know i will",
    "miss, because i always miss when it",
    "takes so long.",
    "surface, no edge, the wall",
    "fades into the air and the air is",
    "my hand, and i am the wall. my",
    "arm is the syringe and thus i",
    "become the nurse, i am you,",
    "nurse. if he gets",
    "around the bases before the",
    "ball comes down, is it a home",
    "run, even if i catch it?",
    "slow down, and stop, we",
    "would be one fused mass careening",
    "at too great a speed through",
    "the emptiness. if i catch",
    "the ball, our side will",
    "be up, and i will have to bat,",
    "and i might strike out."
