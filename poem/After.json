    "You call me to the bath, where",
    "by evening light before bed I rub",
    "the ointment into your maculate back.",

    "of your scapulae, where you cannot",
    "reach, cannot see\u2014the arc of your life",
    "revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored",
    "spots\u2014and hover there awhile,",
    "remembering how we watched the lover",
    "read the manuscript painted on the skin",
    "of his beloved; how he pressed",
    "the words to his chest and face\u2014and cried out.",
    "The arteries in my palm open, their warmth",
    "rising between us as I massage you, neither",
    "sexual nor umbilical,",
    "this connection\u2014you trusting",
    "your back to me, and",
    "me with no deceit.",
    "Only salve, only unguent.",
    "Only balm."
