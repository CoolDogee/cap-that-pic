    "You marched into the gray eyes of dawn",
    "feeling older than the bones",
    "that held their ground",
    "like grazing, aged cattle",
    "waiting, eyes closed to the wind,",
    "on a winter, slaughter morning.",
    "You searched through the fog for a sign,",
    "but there was no sun to burn the way,",
    "no burst of rainbow bridge",
    "to keep you from the cattle call."
