    "To lie in your child\u2019s bed when she is gone",
    "Is calming as anything I know. To fall",
    "Asleep, her books arranged above your head,",
    "Is to admit that you have never been",
    "So tired, so enchanted by the spell",
    "Of your grown body. To feel small instead",
    "Of blocking out the light, to feel alone,",
    "Not knowing what you should or shouldn\u2019t feel,",
    "Is to find out, no matter what you\u2019ve said",
    "About the cramped escapes and obstacles",
    "You plan and face and have to call the world,",
    "That there remain these places, occupied",
    "By children, yours if lucky, like the girl",
    "Who finds you here and lies down by your side."
