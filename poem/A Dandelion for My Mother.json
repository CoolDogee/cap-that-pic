    "of yellow hair, the bowl-cut fringe.",
    "How sturdy they were and how",
    "slowly they turned themselves",
    "into galaxies, domes of ghost stars",
    "barely visible by day, pale",
    "cerebrums clinging to life",
    "on tough green stems. Like you.",
    "Like you, in the end. If you were here,",
    "I\u2019d pluck this trembling globe to show",
    "how beautiful a thing can be",
    "a breath will tear away."
