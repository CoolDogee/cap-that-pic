    "No feeding on wisteria. No pitch-burner traipsing",
    "In the nettled woods. No milk in metal cylinders, no",
    "Buttering. No making small contusions on the page",
    "But saying nothing no one has not said before.",
    "No milkweed blown across your pony-coat, no burrs.",
    "No scent of juniper on your Jacobean mouth. No crush",
    "Of ink or injury, no lacerating wish.",
    "Extinguish me from this.",
    "I was sixteen for twenty years. By September I will be a ghost",
    "And flickering in unison with all the other fireflies in Appalachia,",
    "Blinking in the swarm of it, and all at once, above",
    "And on a bare branch in a shepherd's sky. No Dove.",
    "There is no thou to speak of."
