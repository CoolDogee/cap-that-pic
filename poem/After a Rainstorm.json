    "Because I have come to the fence at night,",
    "the horses arrive also from their ancient stable.",
    "They let me stroke their long faces, and I note",
    "in the light of the now-merging moon",
    "how they, a Morgan and a Quarter, have been",
    "by shake-guttered raindrops",
    "spotted around their rumps and thus made",
    "Appaloosas, the ancestral horses of this place.",
    "Maybe because it is night, they are nervous,",
    "or maybe because they too sense",
    "what they have become, they seem",
    "to be waiting for me to say something",
    "to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here,",
    "that they might awaken from this strange dream,",
    "in which there are fences and stables and a man",
    "who doesn\u2019t know a single word they understand."
