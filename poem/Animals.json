    "As the extinguished.",
    "As creatures, coming out to play",
    "in the twilight of creation",
    "human faces intelligent and suffering,",
    "turned upward entering the trees.",
    "The charismatic megafauna:",
    "polar bears, moose, rippling massive flanks",
    "to shake loose biting flies.",
    "The fox and the vixen. The leopard",
    "dazzling in his camouflage, breaking",
    "the urgent glass. In the underlayer",
    "of humus and moss and broken clay",
    "the cryptogams, the earthworms turning",
    "between the wizardly fingers",
    "of the forest, managed growth",
    "of the second order, the third, steered",
    "toward what shoal, a history",
    "for the benefit of imaginary extrinsic persons.",
    "In the branches snowy owls",
    "and ravens, or the rock pigeons we call",
    "pigeons, that can\u2019t perch in trees, that swarm cities",
    "like the flying rats they are, hungry,",
    "iridescent at the neck like the",
    "rats themselves shining like a collar",
    "at the base of a public sculpture",
    "monument to the fundamental flight",
    "through corridors of power, mathematics,",
    "heat death rippling like an invisible wave",
    "down State Street, paralleling Michigan,",
    "pushed by the restless concinnations",
    "of the El, cutting longitudes across the lake itself,",
    "desert of water",
    "meeting the migrations of alien carp and",
    "cosmic rays, diving deep for the wreck",
    "of the",
    "or swimming invisible lines, boundaries",
    "policed by radar, from Canada",
    "a mass of air launched by minute variations",
    "in temperature, push and pull over heat",
    "islands, carbon dioxide absorption,",
    "ozone exhaustion invisible and intervening",
    "like a god: that which manifests",
    "through its action on substance, not itself",
    "substance: weak forces, atmospheres,",
    "unnamed unmet animal species",
    "gone extinct, whole genuses, phyla,",
    "unknowable kingdoms and principalities,",
    "coral reefs burned black like",
    "the crouched and burdened angels,",
    "muscular sketches of our vacancy",
    "as in an etching by Blake, horizontal,",
    "the spiritual body",
    "dividing like a hyphen the upper from the lower,",
    "phatic messenger of betweenness,",
    "inhuman round eyes fixed on nothing, on suffering,",
    "folly, sporting events, on Gaza \u2014",
    "wings outstretched to bandage the eyes of Heaven,",
    "our eyes",
    "as they would bandage the wound of a headless child",
    "or conceal the strength of a people",
    "from their weakness, the mortals",
    "masquerading as their own fates, individuals",
    "slashed open by solitude, acts of mourning",
    "and revenge, writing themselves",
    "into the text of righteousness. The messengers",
    "reveal nothing, like the animals",
    "marching slowly toward me now, two by two,",
    "tongues lolling, eyes lit from within hollow and sparkling",
    "as a cave concealed from light for thirty thousand years",
    "but concealed no longer. Grace have I none",
    "but what can be inferred",
    "by arms opening, palms, head tilting back",
    "to catch rain in my jaws:",
    "what is born, now, what wrests its way",
    "out of the eternal feminine, the body",
    "my only warrant, against monuments my pledge",
    "to the immaculate moment. What is born",
    "is not of me, or the we, or of god, or animals.",
    "It is a wing. It is bleeding.",
    "It masks my eyes until the thunder comes",
    "to open the openness over all."
