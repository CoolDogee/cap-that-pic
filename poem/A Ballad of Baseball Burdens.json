    "The burden of hard hitting. Slug away",
    "Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb.",
    "Else fandom shouteth: \u201cWho said you could play?",
    "Back to the jasper league, you minor slob!\u201d",
    "Swat, hit, connect, line out, get on the job.",
    "Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom\u2019s ire",
    "Biff, bang it, clout it, hit it on the knob\u2014",
    "The burden of good pitching. Curved or straight.",
    "Or in or out, or haply up or down,",
    "To puzzle him that standeth by the plate,",
    "To lessen, so to speak, his bat-renoun:",
    "Like Christy Mathewson or Miner Brown,",
    "So pitch that every man can but admire",
    "And offer you the freedom of the town\u2014",
    "The burden of loud cheering. O the sounds!",
    "The tumult and the shouting from the throats",
    "Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds",
    "Sitting, ay, standing",
    "their hats and coats.",
    "A mighty cheer that possibly denotes",
    "That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire;",
    "Or, as H. James would say, We\u2019ve got their goats\u2014",
    "The burden of a pennant. O the hope,",
    "The tenuous hope, the hope that\u2019s half a fear,",
    "The lengthy season and the boundless dope,",
    "And the bromidic; \u201cWait until next year.\u201d",
    "O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear,",
    "O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher",
    "That next October it shall flutter here:",
    "ENVOY",
    "Ah, Fans, let not the Quarry but the Chase",
    "Be that to which most fondly we aspire!",
    "For us not Stake, but Game; not Goal, but Race\u2014"
