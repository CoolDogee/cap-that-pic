    "Near the dry river\u2019s water-mark we found",
    "Your brother Minnegan,",
    "Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.",
    "Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,",
    "Told me to find you, even in the rain,",
    "And tell you he was drowned.",
    "I hid behind the chassis on the bank,",
    "The wreck of someone\u2019s Ford:",
    "I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:",
    "You told me once the waking up was hard,",
    "The daylight beating at you like a board.",
    "Blood in my stomach sank.",
    "Beside, you told him never to go out",
    "Along the river-side",
    "Drinking and singing, clattering about.",
    "You might have thrown a rock at me and cried",
    "I was to blame, I let him fall in the road",
    "And pitch down on his side.",
    "Well, I\u2019ll get hell enough when I get home",
    "For coming up this far,",
    "Leaving the note, and running as I came.",
    "I\u2019ll go and tell my father where you are.",
    "You\u2019d better go find Minnegan before",
    "Policemen hear and come.",
    "Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,",
    "You old son of a bitch.",
    "You better hurry down to Minnegan;",
    "He\u2019s drunk or dying now, I don\u2019t know which,",
    "Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,",
    "The poor old man."
