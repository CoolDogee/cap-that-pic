    "Whispering to each handhold, \u201cI'll be back,\u201d",
    "I go up the cliff in the dark. One place",
    "I loosen a rock and listen a long time",
    "till it hits, faint in the gulf, but the rush",
    "of the torrent almost drowns it out, and the wind\u2014",
    "I almost forgot the wind: it tears at your side",
    "or it waits and then buffets; you sag outward. . . .",
    "I remember they said it would be hard. I scramble",
    "by luck into a little pocket out of",
    "the wind and begin to beat on the stones",
    "with my scratched numb hands, rocking back and forth",
    "in silent laughter there in the dark\u2014",
    "\u201cMade it again!\u201d Oh how I love this climb!",
    "\u2014the whispering to stones, the drag, the weight",
    "as your muscles crack and ease on, working",
    "right. They are back there, discontent,",
    "waiting to be driven forth. I pound",
    "on the earth, riding the earth past the stars:",
    "\u201cMade it again! Made it again!\u201d"
