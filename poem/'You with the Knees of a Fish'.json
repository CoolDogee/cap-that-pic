    "You with the knees of a fish,",
    "You with the fish's ears, the tongue in your round",
    "Mouth that's nibbling the sweet air,",
    "You with a fish's patience, on your side",
    "Under the hot plank ot the keel, hook in your lip,",
    "And your tail twitching like a bothered lily,",
    "And the taste of your own bleeding on the air, salt on the sweetness,",
    "You with a fish's voice, singing and still",
    "Your aria, and the blue-silver flecks of light,",
    "The water's scales, breathing the breeze",
    "Abundant and not for you, you with a hook,",
    "Absurd, you with lidless mercuried eyes;",
    "And the reel whistles, the tall man's cast at you."
