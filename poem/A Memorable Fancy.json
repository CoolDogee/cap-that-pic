    ", she said, suddenly aware that this was indeed a fact, as was the yoke around the woman\u2019s upright neck. Her nostrils flared, her body strained against it, Al Green in the background.",
    "she asked, meaning do you feel that tug?",
    ", the woman said,",
    ". Behind her the city slickened: vehicles everywhere, idling, honking, revving, stiffening themselves against her. The braided woman did not flinch.",
