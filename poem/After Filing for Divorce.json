    "Your paperwork in, it\u2019s like the morning after",
    "a party, the shaken survey of damage,",
    "a waste of bottles where there was laughter.",
    "It all seems so much more than you can manage:",
    "the accusing cups and stubbed-out cigarettes,",
    "the sun assaulting the window, your throbbing head.",
    "It\u2019s not enough to face your own regrets",
    "(though they\u2019re coming back fast, the things you said)",
    "because someone\u2019s trailed bean dip across the table,",
    "someone\u2019s ground salsa in the rug with his shoe.",
    "So you start to clean, as much as you are able,",
    "and think how far those hours have fled from you,",
    "before the hangover and your sour tongue,",
    "when you felt lovely, and infinite, and young."
