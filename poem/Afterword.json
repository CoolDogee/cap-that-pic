    "I stopped precipitously, so that my story seems to have been",
    "slightly distorted, ending, as it did, not abruptly",
    "but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort",

    "which seems to me a crutch, a phase,",
    "the adolescence of the mind, perhaps\u2014",
    "Still, it was a term I used myself,",
    "frequently to explain my failures.",
    "Fate, destiny, whose designs and warnings",
    "now seem to me simply",
    "local symmetries, metonymic",
    "baubles within immense confusion\u2014",
    "Chaos was what I saw.",
    "My brush froze\u2014I could not paint it.",
    "Darkness, silence: that was the feeling.",
    "What did we call it then?",

    "Characters came and went, costumes were changed,",
    "my brush hand moved side to side",

    "I took a deep breath. And it came to me",
    "the person who drew that breath",
    "was not the person in my story, his childish hand",
    "confidently wielding the crayon\u2014",
    "Had I been that person? A child but also",
    "an explorer to whom the path is suddenly clear, for whom",
