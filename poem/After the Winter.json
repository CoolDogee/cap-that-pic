    "Some day, when trees have shed their leaves",
    "And against the morning\u2019s white",
    "The shivering birds beneath the eaves",
    "Have sheltered for the night,",
    "We\u2019ll turn our faces southward, love,",
    "Toward the summer isle",
    "Where bamboos spire the shafted grove",
    "And wide-mouthed orchids smile.",
    "And we will seek the quiet hill",
    "Where towers the cotton tree,",
    "And leaps the laughing crystal rill,",
    "And works the droning bee.",
    "And we will build a cottage there",
    "Beside an open glade,",
    "With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,",
    "And ferns that never fade."
