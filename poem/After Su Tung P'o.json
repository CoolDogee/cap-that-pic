    "When a child is born, the parents say",
    "they hope it's healthy and intelligent. But as for me\u2014",
    "well, vigor and intelligence have wrecked my life. I pray",
    "this baby we are seeing walloped, wiped and winningly anointed,",
    "turns out dumb as oakum\u2014and more sinister. That way",
    "he can crown a tranquil life by being",
    "appointed a cabinet minister."
