    "Once you saw a drove of young pigs",
    "crossing the highway. One of them",
    "pulling his body by the front feet,",
    "the hind legs dragging flat.",
    "Without thinking,",
    "you called the Humane Society.",
    "They came with a net and went for him.",
    "They were matter of fact, uniformed;",
    "there were two of them,",
    "their truck ominous, with a cage.",
    "He was hiding in the weeds. It was then",
    "you saw his eyes. He understood.",
    "He was trembling.",
    "After they took him, you began to suffer regret.",
    "Years later, you remember his misfit body",
    "scrambling to reach the others.",
    "Even at this moment, your heart",
    "is going too fast; your hands sweat."
