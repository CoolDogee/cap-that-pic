    "Somebody down there hates us deeply,",
    "Has planted a thorn where slightest woe may overrun.",
    "Disorderly and youthful sorrow, many divots picked at since",
    "Across the thrice-hounded comfort zone.",
    "Can\u2019t cut it, sees permanent crones",
    "Encroaching aside likely lanes of executive tar",
    "All spread skyward.",
    "You got the picture, Bub:",
    "This world is ours no more,",
    "And those other euphemisms for grimly twisting wrath,",
    "A wire-mesh semblance bedecked",
    "With twilight\u2019s steamy regard.",
    "Look at the wind out here.",
    "Delete imperative.",
    "Hours where money rinses life like sex,",
    "Whichever nowadays serves as its signifier."
