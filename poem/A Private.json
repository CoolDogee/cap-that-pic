    "This ploughman dead in battle slept out of doors",
    "Many a frosty night, and merrily",
    "Answered staid drinkers, good bedmen, and all bores:",
    "'At Mrs Greenland's Hawthorn Bush,' said he,",
    "'I slept.' None knew which bush. Above the town,",
    "Beyond 'The Drover', a hundred spot the down",
    "In Wiltshire. And where now at last he sleeps",
    "More sound in France\u2014that, too, he secret keeps."
