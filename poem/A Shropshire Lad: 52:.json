    "Far in a western brookland",
    "That bred me long ago",
    "The poplars stand and tremble",
    "By pools I used to know.",
    "There, in the windless night-time,",
    "The wanderer, marvelling why,",
    "Halts on the bridge to hearken",
    "How soft the poplars sigh.",
    "He hears: long since forgotten",
    "In fields where I was known,",
    "Here I lie down in London",
    "And turn to rest alone.",
    "There, by the starlit fences,",
    "The wanderer halts and hears",
    "My soul that lingers sighing",
    "About the glimmering weirs."
