    "The forward youth that would appear",
    "Must now forsake his Muses dear,",
    "Nor in the shadows sing",
    "His numbers languishing.",
    "\u2019Tis time to leave the books in dust,",
    "And oil th\u2019 unused armour\u2019s rust,",
    "Removing from the wall",
    "The corslet of the hall.",
    "So restless Cromwell could not cease",
    "In the inglorious arts of peace,",
    "But thorough advent\u2019rous war",
    "Urged his active star.",
    "And like the three-fork\u2019d lightning, first",
    "Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,",
    "Did through his own side",
    "His fiery way divide.",
    "For \u2019tis all one to courage high,",
    "The emulous or enemy;",
    "And with such to enclose",
    "Is more than to oppose.",
    "Then burning through the air he went,",
    "And palaces and temples rent;",
    "And C\u00e6sar\u2019s head at last",
    "Did through his laurels blast.",
    "\u2019Tis madness to resist or blame",
    "The force of angry Heaven\u2019s flame;",
    "And, if we would speak true,",
    "Much to the man is due,",
    "Who from his private gardens where",
    "He liv\u2019d reserved and austere,",
    "As if his highest plot",
    "To plant the bergamot,",
    "Could by industrious valour climb",
    "To ruin the great work of time,",
    "And cast the kingdom old",
    "Into another mould.",
    "Though justice against fate complain,",
    "And plead the ancient rights in vain;",
    "But those do hold or break",
    "As men are strong or weak.",
    "Nature that hateth emptiness",
    "Allows of penetration less,",
    "And therefore must make room",
    "Where greater spirits come.",
    "What field of all the civil wars",
    "Where his were not the deepest scars?",
    "And Hampton shows what part",
    "He had of wiser art,",
    "Where, twining subtle fears with hope,",
    "He wove a net of such a scope",
    "That Charles himself might chase",
    "To Carisbrooke\u2019s narrow case,",
    "That thence the royal actor borne",
    "The tragic scaffold might adorn,",
    "While round the armed bands",
    "Did clap their bloody hands.",
    "He nothing common did or mean",
    "Upon that memorable scene,",
    "But with his keener eye",
    "The axe\u2019s edge did try;",
    "Nor call\u2019d the gods with vulgar spite",
    "To vindicate his helpless right,",
    "But bowed his comely head",
    "Down as upon a bed.",
    "This was that memorable hour",
    "Which first assur\u2019d the forced pow\u2019r.",
    "So when they did design",
    "The Capitol\u2019s first line,",
    "A bleeding head, where they begun,",
    "Did fright the architects to run;",
    "And yet in that the state",
    "Foresaw its happy fate.",
    "And now the Irish are asham\u2019d",
    "To see themselves in one year tam\u2019d;",
    "So much one man can do",
    "That does both act and know.",
    "They can affirm his praises best,",
    "And have, though overcome, confest",
    "How good he is, how just,",
    "And fit for highest trust;",
    "Nor yet grown stiffer with command,",
    "But still in the republic\u2019s hand;",
    "How fit he is to sway",
    "That can so well obey.",
    "He to the Commons\u2019 feet presents",
    "A kingdom for his first year\u2019s rents;",
    "And, what he may, forbears",
    "His fame, to make it theirs,",
    "And has his sword and spoils ungirt,",
    "To lay them at the public\u2019s skirt.",
    "So when the falcon high",
    "Falls heavy from the sky,",
    "She, having kill\u2019d, no more does search",
    "But on the next green bough to perch,",
    "Where, when he first does lure,",
    "The falc\u2019ner has her sure.",
    "What may not then our isle presume",
    "While victory his crest does plume!",
    "What may not others fear",
    "If thus he crown each year!",
    "A C\u00e6sar he ere long to Gaul,",
    "To Italy an Hannibal,",
    "And to all states not free,",
    "Shall climacteric be.",
    "The Pict no shelter now shall find",
    "Within his parti-colour\u2019d mind;",
    "But from this valour sad",
    "Shrink underneath the plaid,",
    "Happy if in the tufted brake",
    "The English hunter him mistake,",
    "Nor lay his hounds in near",
    "The Caledonian deer.",
    "But thou, the war\u2019s and fortune\u2019s son,",
    "March indefatigably on;",
    "And for the last effect",
    "Still keep thy sword erect;",
    "Besides the force it has to fright",
    "The spirits of the shady night,",
    "The same arts that did gain",
    "A pow\u2019r, must it maintain."
