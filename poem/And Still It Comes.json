    "like a downhill brakes-burned freight train",
    "full of pig iron ingots, full of lead",
    "life-size statues of Richard Nixon,",
    "like an avalanche of smoke and black fog",
    "lashed by bent pins, the broken-off tips",
    "of switchblade knives, the dust of dried offal,",
    "remorseless, it comes, faster when you turn your back,",
    "faster when you turn to face it,",
    "like a fine rain, then colder showers,",
    "then downpour to razor sleet, then egg-size hail,",
    "fist-size, then jagged",
    "laser, shrapnel hail",
    "thudding and tearing like footsteps",
    "of drunk gods or fathers; it comes",
    "polite, loutish, assured, suave,",
    "breathing through its mouth",
    "(which is a hole eaten by a cave),",
    "it comes like an elephant annoyed,",
    "like a black mamba terrified, it slides",
    "down the valley, grease on grease,",
    "like fire eating birds\u2019 nests,",
    "like fire melting the fuzz",
    "off a baby\u2019s skull, still it comes: mute",
    "and gorging, never",
    "to cease, insatiable, gorging",
    "and mute."
