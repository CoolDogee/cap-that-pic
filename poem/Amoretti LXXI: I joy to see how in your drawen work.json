    "I joy to see how in your drawen work,",
    "Your selfe unto the Bee ye doe compare;",
    "And me unto the Spyder that doth lurke,",
    "In close awayt to catch her unaware.",
    "Right so your selfe were caught in cunning snare",
    "Of a deare for, and thralled to his love:",
    "In whose streight bands ye now captived are",
    "So firmely, that ye never may remove.",
    "But as your whole worke is woven all about,",
    "With woodbynd flowers and fragrant Enlantine:",
    "So sweet your prison you in time shall prove,",
    "With many deare delights bedecked fyne,",
    "And all thensforth eternall peace shall see",
    "Betweene the Spyder and the gentle Bee."
