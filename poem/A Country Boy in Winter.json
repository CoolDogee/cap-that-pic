    "The wind may blow the snow about,",
    "For all I care, says Jack,",
    "And I don\u2019t mind how cold it grows,",
    "For then the ice won\u2019t crack.",
    "Old folks may shiver all day long,",
    "But I shall never freeze;",
    "What cares a jolly boy like me",
    "For winter days like these?",
    "Far down the long snow-covered hills",
    "It is such fun to coast,",
    "So clear the road! the fastest sled",
    "There is in school I boast.",
    "The paint is pretty well worn off,",
    "But then I take the lead;",
    "A dandy sled\u2019s a loiterer,",
    "And I go in for speed.",
    "When I go home at supper-time,",
    "Ki! but my cheeks are red!",
    "They burn and sting like anything;",
    "I\u2019m cross until I\u2019m fed.",
    "You ought to see the biscuit go,",
    "I am so hungry then;",
    "And old Aunt Polly says that boys",
    "Eat twice as much as men.",
    "There\u2019s always something I can do",
    "To pass the time away;",
    "The dark comes quick in winter-time\u2014",
    "A short and stormy day",
    "And when I give my mind to it,",
    "It\u2019s just as father says,",
    "I almost do a man\u2019s work now,",
    "And help him many ways.",
    "I shall be glad when I grow up",
    "And get all through with school,",
    "I\u2019ll show them by-and-by that I",
    "Was not meant for a fool.",
    "I\u2019ll take the crops off this old farm,",
    "I\u2019ll do the best I can.",
    "A jolly boy like me won\u2019t be",
    "A dolt when he\u2019s a man.",
    "I like to hear the old horse neigh",
    "Just as I come in sight,",
    "The oxen poke me with their horns",
    "To get their hay at night.",
    "Somehow the creatures seem like friends,",
    "And like to see me come.",
    "Some fellows talk about New York,",
    "But I shall stay at home."
