    "Slip-pilings on the Brooklyn littoral",
    "\u2014the poles still tarry, flimsy; the ferry terminus",
    "with its walledup doors wan doorshapes",
    "on eroded sills. Downstream, the strutwork",
    "of the Williamsburg cable tower",
    "threw its cool shadow half a mile inland",
    "over tarpaper seams, gantried water butts,",
    "and splintery tenement cornices milled",
    "with acanthus and classical grasses",
    "of nineteenth-century dream-slum fantasy.",
    "We could see, from our rooftops, the endspan",
    "floating its ant-threads of traffic",
    "to the granite salients of the anchorage,",
    "and through its strands on the west",
    "the Financial District\u2019s watery silhouettes.",
    "But it was our own foundations, crumbling",
    "in the sandy soil, that made us protest",
    "the drill rigs sounding for a wider bridge ramp",
    "to funnel the airport traffic over us",
    "into Manhattan. \u201cConstruction tremors",
    "will weaken our buildings\u201d: from the over-roosted",
    "tenements clinging near the anchorage",
    "flew manuscript lists of signatures, block-groups\u2019",
    "painfully Englished petitions. But City Hall",
    "adoze, sleep-feeding, just flooded us",
    "with chimerical figures and blueprints,",
    "wearing us down. Our own \u201cblock-leader,\u201d Luz,",
    "a Guatemalan law student at NYU",
    "where I studied classics, distracted us",
    "more easily with her \u201cpure language\u201d",
    "or anti-Puerto Rican tirades. \u201cCall that Spanish?",
    "Take my sitter\u2014",
    "still speaks some",
    "Maya mountain-language BUT",
    "the beautiful Spanish!\u201d And so one evening this sitter,",
    "Pilar, came over\u2014forty, perhaps, with a long",
    "fawn-tinted oval face, and read in low tones",
    "an archaic poem to the Madonna. \u201cMy daughter",
    "knows it in Quich\u00e9 and English\u2014\u201d and she passed around,",
    "wistfully, a First Communion photo\u2014flat cheekbones",
    "like her mother\u2019s, long black braids, straight look.",
    "Luz told us Pilar had lost husband",
    "and son to the",
    "a machine-gunned",
    "death heap in the center of their village\u2014",
    "\u201cThey killed all the men. But when my family",
    "came here, she came with her girl, we helped with the",
    "green card, and she\u2019s a hotel maid now",
    "near the UN ...\u201d Much realer, this, than our own",
    "bridge-inflicted, some-day disaster. And who knew",
    "but our bridge might metamorphose,",
    "as the City said (\u201cGlobal cities draw capital\u201d), into a river",
    "of money (\u201cWe\u2019ll all sell",
    "on the ramp\u201d),",
    "and anyway, mainly, summer",
    "was running out, with its open evenings",
    "and windows. One Saturday, turning onto my block",
    "from the subway, I heard my name, crossed",
    "the street where twin buildings had area-ways.",
    "and saw you waving, the same, Pilar,",
    "from a window below the swag-bellied area railings.",
    "\u201cCome have some coffee\u2014go around in back.\u201d",
    "I walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered",
    "airwell by a door with multiple doorbells.",
    "You opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted,",
    "with padlocked doors. \u201cSee, the super\u2019s cut up his flat",
    "for illegals. They took out an inside wall, so our room",
    "has a window\u2014we all share the bath.\u201d I entered",
    "a lime-walled room\u2014chairs and table, sofa-bed. Your front wall",
    "was the building front, the three others",
    "drywall. On the bureau, a black-shawled",
    ": two photos; two candles in translucent, white-waxed sacks,",
    "and a polychrome Madonna with meeting brows.",
    "Through your window, car wheels, railings; and, above,",
    "my own second-story windows. \u201cWe saw you",
    "reading there,\u201d you said from behind me, \u201cwhen we moved in.\u201d",
    "You sat me on the sofa, and formally presented your daughter",
    "(she moved her schoolbooks all to one end.) Near her, a shallow,",
    "linoleumed-over trench and a bathroom sink. You said:",
    "\u201cI\u2019m a widow from the mountains near Morache, very near",
    "the home-town of Se\u00f1ora Luz. My real work is hotel maid, and I\u2019ve got",
    "a nice job, at a place called the Tricontinental.\u201d",
    "Then you paused, and I felt how clearly",
    "you\u2019d presented yourself, as Americans do, with your job,",
    "your",
    "and I said: \u201cI\u2019m a graduate student",
    "at NYU, where Luz studies, no, not married, no children ...\u201d",
    "I tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ...",
    "definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors,",
    "and soon we were hardly listening, waiting",
    "for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. Pequita",
    "told us what the priest had said",
    "about the drilling; you spoke of Pequita\u2019s",
    "First Communion, and none of us could stop",
    "finding striking things to say. Next day you came over",
    "to see my plants, and I came back for soup-supper, looking up",
    "at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light",
    "of autumn looked oddly beckoning. As we ate,",
    "you leaned forward, with a sudden rogue\u2019s smile,",
    "and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge,",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s a path up there. If the bridge",
    "is bad, we\u2019ll tell off the Mayor\u2014\u201d (In what spirit, I wondered,",
    "had you listened to our committee?) And when I got home",
    "I looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you",
    "cleaning up, and Pequita, at the table, reading.",
    "But next week, instead of the plank stair",
    "that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered",
    "the riverside shipping alleys. From below, we could see",
    "overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel",
    "the resonant top-thrum of westbound",
    "subways and trucks. Then the riverside\u2014I loved",
    "this part. A sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny",
    "terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside",
    "from the drillings, and abandoned wreckers\u2019 lots",
    "filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned",
    "panicles of switchgrass. Its timelessness",
    "soothed me\u2014though ephemeral. Even that day, one freshly",
    "tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze",
    "Edwardian mermaid doorknockers. I could see",
    "our quarter five years from now, say\u2014the withering",
    "discount chains, tentative boutiques,",
    "and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale",
    "\u201cpioneers,\u201d as neighborhood indigenes, living on",
    "with strange literalness among them, supplying",
    "their just-permissible quantum of urban grit.",
    "You were ahead, and Pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks",
    "with a stray lath. As we progressed in and out",
    "of the endspan\u2019s slatted shadows, you turned",
    "and called me into a side-lot\u2014sunken concrete, flask-",
    "green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. It had been",
    "interior, once\u2014rows of soiled roomsized",
    "plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling",
    "toilet, like a pearl. In a lower square, fringed",
    "with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti,",
    "was a mural.",
    "the mountain",
    "dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees",
    "and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled",
    "castanets. And you lifted yourself on tiptoe,",
    "Pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed",
    "Pequita\u2019s cheek. I felt a pang, as if I already needed you",
    "sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture",
    "as if, exiled within, you reached out\u2014 We stepped",
    "back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said:",
    "\u201cLuz likes to say I\u2019m some mountain-woman, but when",
    "my mother died, I lived with my aunt in the City\u2014I only",
    "went back when I married.\u201d I told her I\u2019d lived",
    "in this city, with a stepmother, who\u2019d divorced my uncle",
    "to marry my father; and beat me. \u201cA stepmother\u2019s",
    "a curse of God,\u201d you said gently. And on the walk back,",
    "pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until New York",
    "seemed a dot in a belt of capitals",
    "high on the globe: world-cities, packed",
    "with immigrants, refugees,",
    "a snowy",
    "latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.",
    "We were a threesome. Coffee, suppers, TV,",
    "Pequita at my computer\u2014you\u2019d asked me to teach her\u2014",
    "or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month",
    "they moved you to night shift. Yet only that summer,",
    "I\u2019d worked in my window like a scholar",
    "in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises,",
    "like Roman Juvenal, to whose ears \u201ccame ever",
    "the sounds of buildings collapsing.\u201d Across, the two",
    "tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails",
    "of fire-escape bedding. And everything underlit",
    "by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street.",
    "But now it was the dailiness of two",
    "from another hemisphere. Through snow-fissures, winds fluting",
    "on railings and building-flaws, Pilar in her low frame",
    "paced with armfuls of laundry, washed",
    "in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. The thousand",
    "stratagems of those who simply",
    "spend;",
    "and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred",
    "periphery, housekeeping around her,",
    "you\u2019d make yourself interrupt her, to mop",
    "behind your sweeping. And Pequita\u2014I saw her wrap",
    "you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you",
    "orange juice, as they\u2019d taught her in school, for she",
    "loved you, she was the person who loved you\u2014",
    "I saw too, that of what I wanted the university",
    "to be for me\u2014a tiny model of the city",
    "with its own rules and subsets: \u201cTell me",
    "each day who I am\u201d\u2014you\u2019d found your part",
    "in Pequita; I followed the shape",
    "of your day touching center as it funneled",
    "into her hand and moving pencil-point.",
    "For everything seemed natural to Pequita:",
    "the Credo, her photocopied choir music",
    "piled beside the tidy",
    "our neighborhood of syringe-filled gutters, drug-stoops and pimps,",
    "her school\u2019s turkey cutouts, metal detectors, backed-up toilets ...",
    "Our human wilderness, half-urban, half-surreal",
    "to her was a matter-of-fact Eden, like the picturesque ruins",
    "and laughably rococo grottoes imagined",
    "by the",
    "as the Golden Age.",
    "\u2014And I, I thought her whole world, it comes back\u2014",
    "touching, as if her child\u2019s paradisial will were there",
    "for my affectionate recreation, like our still faithfully,",
    "occasionally, typed-up and dispatched",
    "protests from the Ramp Committee to the Mayor. Slight effects",
    "of perspective, tiny human gestures",
    "giving point to the city\u2019s vast, ironic beauty.",
    "At a moment when no one was thinking",
    "about her, Pequita awoke. Perhaps",
    "she enjoyed the solitude, Pilar asleep,",
    "me asleep across the street. She got up",
    "and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug",
    "before the sink. At seven the drills started,",
    "deeper-toned than ever before (they woke me)\u2014",
    "and part of your ceiling fell in; a beam",
    "splintered, plummeting straight to the oval rug\u2014",
    "The person screaming over the phone",
    "was Pilar. I thought it must be really",
    "all right, or she\u2019d be crying not screaming,",
    "but when I\u2019d called 911 and run over, Pequita",
    "was barely alive.",
    "Then the hospital corridors,",
    "me trying to close my winter coat",
    "(the buttons were off) on my nightgown, you",
    "on a bench, staring straight ahead.",
    "When they said Pequita was",
    "\u201cgone,\u201d you were utterly silent. I brought you",
    "to my place (though our street was a tangle",
    "of police lights and yellow tape), terrified",
    "of your fixed inner focus, as if you had",
    "a plan ... Next night I had Luz stay over,",
    "I slept at her place; the third I was back. You,",
    "thank God (I thought), were crying, and Luz",
    "had set up the service. She propelled us downstairs",
    "and to a tiny brick church I must often have passed",
    "without seeing it, two blocks inland.",
    "Egg-blue inside, it was, with a little green",
    "and gilt altar, dark Stations on the walls,",
    "and the statue of the Virgin of Guadeloupe",
    "placed oddly below the altar stairs, so that Pilar,",
    "after the death-mass, could kneel",
    "before her, praying straight into her face,",
    "while I on a kneeler buried mine in my hands.",
    "What would the mother live for now, the hotel, me, or Luz,",
    "already writing more endless mad letters? Yet only these",
    "had from the City real answers: they\u2019d brace the drill site",
    "with vibration-absorbing piers; and they wanted",
    "her and her friend Mrs. Citrin to know",
    "\u201cthat no one else had been more than lightly injured.\u201d",
    "It was the end of winter, very dark. The building",
    "managers, nervy, had moved you to the first floor",
    "next door, till you found a new place (I knew",
    "you weren\u2019t looking). Each day I saw you",
    "arrive from work, answer my call tersely,",
    "then pull down your blinds. A shadow showed rarely,",
    "flattened, shapeless; you lay on your sofa a lot.",
    "\u201cThanks Anne\u2014I\u2019m better without company,\u201d or",
    "\u201cplease understand.\u201d But often, later",
    "in the evening, you\u2019d come down the stairs",
    "and turn inland. Then, one morning as I was passing",
    "with early groceries, you were leaving the parish hall",
    "in your black winter coat, heavily scarved,",
    "and we paused. Approvingly, you tapped one glove",
    "on my armload\u2014you\u2019d told me to cook more, dictated",
    "recipes. I asked if this had been Pequita\u2019s",
    "choir-practice place; the sentence wavered,",
    "but you replied with grim joy,",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s not practicing",
    "\u201d It took me a minute.",
    "Pequita was singing, this moment, in the Presence.",
    "Still what you felt most (it was in your face)",
    "was absence, absence, but from something bitter",
    "in your eyes, that seemed small and round with the cold, I felt",
    "your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies.",
    "What were such luxuries now, ironies, Anglo friends;",
    "and I thought you hated my mind",
    "that remembered the brownpapered books,",
    "the orange juice. I reached to touch your arm\u2014to get past",
    "this, but no, you had to get home:",
    "\u201cI fasted for communion\u201d; and your eyes",
    "swerved away. All my laughable,",
    "my lovely, delusional studies, that I\u2019d seen you",
    "sort through for Pequita, were now an affront. And yet",
    "I felt you moving behind your own mind, as if",
    "with something held in reserve ...",
    "But then you stopped answering the phone, went",
    "less often to church. What I thought",
    "was that you were angry (certainly I was). Perhaps",
    "I thought you needed to talk, and I\u2019d visit you",
    "in Manhattan. So one morning in March,",
    "in the black coat I\u2019d got for the funeral, I walked east",
    "from the forty-second street Lexington stop",
    "to the three-story, fairy-lit jungle atrium",
    "of the Tricontinental, and went to the seventh floor,",
    "where you started. There was a cart in the hall,",
    "a gleaming chrome maid\u2019s cart half-projecting",
    "from a bedroom. On its sides were rows",
    "of glasses with lace sani-bonnets, gold-",
    "stamped mini-soaps and deodorants. It moved out,",
    "and you stood in the door with a sheet-load, looking fat",
    "in a starchy pink uniform monogrammed",
    "When you saw me, you dropped the sheets",
    "and in pain, pressed both palms to your cheeks,",
    "and looked at me looking at you. When",
    "I started sobbing, you took my shoulder and backed me",
    "to the elevator. Pressed the button, stepped back,",
    "and then, to my surprise, gave me a sudden hug",
    "before pushing me in.",
    "It had been always this half-connected",
    "and tenuous, our friendship. What light on my own",
    "isolation and need, that I hadn\u2019t known.",
    "But you actually called me, that week, to propose",
    "our old joke, a bridge walk\u2014maybe Saturday?",
    "Your voice in my ears sounded wobbly",
    "with tension, held-backness, so I got in first:",
    "a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me",
    "a minute Village studio starting June ... After that",
    "I could listen, somber, as you poured out",
    "your need to leave, Luz\u2019s cousin, the possible",
    "hotel job \u201cright in LA.\u201d You added \u201cAnne,\u201d and broke off.",
    "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you that later. Look, it may",
    "snow on Saturday, OK?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d And before",
    "you hung up, I\u2019d resigned you,",
    "given you up. We\u2019d part, on my side",
    "in anger, on yours in oblivion. I met you",
    "at the foot of the anchorage stair",
    "(not the eastern approach, with its easy grade",
    "near the ramp site). We climbed through the snow,",
    "slowly, pausing at landings for different",
    "views of our old alley world. Like a museum",
    "of disused urban functions\u2014we noted a bricked-over",
    "backyard privy arch, and from higher, roof-huts, inkily distinct,",
    "of old-style tenement dumbwaiters. The whole scene",
    "thrown out of drawing by one of those giant",
    "NYC cable-spools, charred at the bottom",
    "where some homeless had tried to burn it.",
    "The moist snow was sweeping",
    "through the cable tower when we clambered",
    "onto the path beneath it. As we moved, hunched slightly,",
    "onto the mainspan, the whole city abruptly",
    "whited-out to a monochrome geometry",
    "of vertical and stooping gray lines. I thought",
    "how Pequita would have loved it, and caught",
    "her mother\u2019s eye. We went on cautiously, soon",
    "pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail",
    "at the traffic lanes below us. \u201cAnne, what",
    "I started to say before\u2014this is it: I\u2019m sorry",
    "I didn\u2019t talk to you\u2014you understand?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d",
    "I lied aimlessly. But you, glancing sideways,",
    "\u201cBut I\u2019m",
    "sorry ...\u201d \u201cNo, really ...\u201d You shook",
    "your head slightly, then took my arm. \u201cOkay then\u2014",
    "what\u2019s this thing?\u201d pointing a snowy boot",
    "at a bolt as high as our knees, with a rusted-on octagonal",
    "nut: \u201cIt\u2019s just a bolt.\u201d You tapped your glove on a strut\u2014",
    "\u201cstrut,\u201d I provided. And you said, pompously, in Luz\u2019 very",
    "intonations (in what spirit had you",
    "listened?)\u2014\u201cThe tolerances just aren\u2019t",
    "\u201d",
    "Then, feeling easier, we started naming everything\u2014",
    "spikes, spun-wire vertical cables: English,",
    "Spanish, and then I heard you speak Quich\u00e9 (words once",
    "for vines, for split trunks",
    "over gorges?) But everything on the bridge was",
    "shabby, neglected-looking; and you said",
    "soberly: \u201cIf anyone was supposed",
    "to look after this bridge, he\u2019s forgot all about it.\u201d",
    "We didn\u2019t link arms again, but started back, pausing",
    "to throw a few loose snowballs",
    "on the Manhattan traffic below us. We\u2019d go",
    "our separate ways\u2014I\u2019d go on delaying, skirting",
    "around my burnt-out places; you\u2019d go",
    "where you could, forget what you could\u2014",
    "some Job-like relinquishment of inquiry",
    "or thought; organisms tend to persist ... When",
    "we got down to the massive base",
    "of the anchorage, we managed a hug",
    "that took in our past, at least: one embrace",
    "of two black winter coats in the snow."
