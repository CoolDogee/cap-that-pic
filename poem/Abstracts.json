    "RED",
    "in the Caf\u00e9 des Anges, juices swamping the willow-pattern skiff",
    "as she dabs her mouth with her napkin, your blind, blind date,",
    "leaving a smudge, lipstick-and-gore, though there\u2019s still a worm",
    "of gristle in the gap between her teeth.",
    "Mood music, candlelight, wine, low voices in a world of harm,",
    "the creature brought down, hindquarters heavy, hind legs",
    "broken by the dogs, its head held up, eyes wide,",
    "the tangle and drag as a gralloch knife unpegs",
    "the bulk, all slippage and seepage, and the way she thumbs",
    "a morsel into your mouth, or smiles your smile",
    "back at you, lets you know that everything\u2019s just as it seems,",
    "then back at the small hotel, she strips off quicker than you",
    "might have hoped, pink as a new-skinned cat, all too",
    "eager to have you by heart. Her cry tells you nothing new.",
    "PURPLE",
    "No? So is it what she is said to have said that night",
    "when she breathed a secret and put the whole room on stall?",
    "Not that? Then it must have something to do with the way,",
    "in the fairy tale when the twins are lost in the wood,",
    "daylight suddenly deepens and it\u2019s run or stay or pray.",
    "Still wrong? Rain in the hanging gardens then? That bruise",
    "you can\u2019t account for? The color of money, win or lose?",
    "BLACK",
    "and windowless it seems, though maybe",
    "the shutters are dropped against the day, loose talk",
    "from women in veils and something like a pulse,",
    "on the air when he opens the door and slips straight in.",
    "The Loden coat, the old slouch hat, the harelip, so who else",
    "could it be, right on time and keen to help? Think back",
    "to those promises, all of them straight from the heart,",
    "never asked for, never kept. The skin trade",
    "It\u2019s been a lifetime coming but now you understand,",
    "or think you do, why what you wanted wasn\u2019t what you planned.",
    "They bring a tray to your bedside. You eat from his hand.",
    "BLUE",
    "that fractures glass or gets so far below",
    "the range of human hearing that it jolts your heart;",
    "and the glass it breaks is blue, and that\u2019s a blue note for sure",
    "from the guy on the alto sax in the basement dive,",
    "which is where they\u2019re bound to meet up in the classic",
    "the private eye, the girl with a shadowy past, the old-style cop,",
    "and it\u2019s nigh-on certain she\u2019ll have to take a bullet",
    "or we\u2019ll see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop.",
    "The fragments of glass were part of it too, that\u2019s plain,",
    "though no one noticed, just as they failed to spot",
    "how the crucifix in her bedroom made sense of the subtle stain",
    "the dive is deeper, the saxophone sadder, the cop",
    "bent as a dog\u2019s hind leg, the girl a scheming slut,",
    "and the gumshoe comes in late with the one and only clue",
    "that would finally set things straight, though its true",
    "meaning is hidden from him, and lost on you.",
    "GREEN",
    "at the moment in his dance when slap-and-tickle",
    "has become a serious matter, and no one\u2019s quicker",
    "in getting his hand up the skirt of some \u201cladye fayre,\u201d",
    "who returns to hearth and home with the rub of the green",
    "on her back for all to see and devil-may-care,",
    "his smell still on her, reek of the barley mow,",
    "and hers on him, which could have been sloe",
    "or sweat and sandalwood, but you\u2019d be the one to know."
