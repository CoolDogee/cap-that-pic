    "High-hearted Surrey! I do love your ways,",
    "Venturous, frank, romantic, vehement,",
    "All with inviolate honor sealed and blent,",
    "To the axe-edge that cleft your soldier-bays:",
    "I love your youth, your friendships, whims, and frays;",
    "Your strict, sweet verse, with its imperious bent,",
    "Heard as in dreams from some old harper\u2019s tent,",
    "And stirring in the listener\u2019s brain for days.",
    "Good father-poet! if to-night there be",
    "At Framlingham none save the north-wind\u2019s sighs,",
    "No guard but moonlight\u2019s crossed and trailing spears,",
    "Smile yet upon the pilgrim named like me,",
    "Close at your gates, whose fond and weary eyes",
    "Sought not one other down three hundred years!"
