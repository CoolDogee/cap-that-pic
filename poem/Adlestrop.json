    "Yes. I remember Adlestrop\u2014",
    "The name, because one afternoon",
    "Of heat the express-train drew up there",
    "Unwontedly. It was late June.",
    "The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.",
    "No one left and no one came",
    "On the bare platform. What I saw",
    "Was Adlestrop\u2014only the name",
    "And willows, willow-herb, and grass,",
    "And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,",
    "No whit less still and lonely fair",
    "Than the high cloudlets in the sky.",
    "And for that minute a blackbird sang",
    "Close by, and round him, mistier,",
    "Farther and farther, all the birds",
    "Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire."
