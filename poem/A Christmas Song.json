    "Christmas is coming. The goose is getting fat",
    "Please put a penny in the old man\u2019s hat.",
    "If you haven\u2019t got a penny, a ha\u2019penny will do.",
    "If you haven\u2019t got a ha\u2019penny, Gold bless you.",
    "Tonight the wide, wet flakes of snow",
    "Drift down like Christmas suicides,",
    "Layering the eaves and boughs until",
    "The landscape seems transformed, as from",
    "A night of talk or love. I\u2019ve come",
    "From cankered ports and railroad hubs",
    "To winter in a northern state:",
    "Three months of wind and little light.",
    "Wood split, flue cleaned, and ashes hauled,",
    "I am now proof against the cold",
    "And make a place before the stove.",
    "Mired fast in middle age, possessed",
    "Of staved-in barn and brambled lot,",
    "I think of that fierce-minded woman",
    "Whom I loved, painting in a small,",
    "Unheated room, or of a friend,",
    "Sharp-ribbed from poverty, who framed",
    "And fitted out his house by hand",
    "And writes each night by kerosene.",
    "I think, that is, of others who",
    "Withdrew from commerce and the world",
    "To work for joy instead of gain.",
    "O would that I could gather them",
    "This Yuletide, and shower them with coins."
