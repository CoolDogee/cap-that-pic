    "O who shall, from this dungeon, raise",
    "A soul enslav\u2019d so many ways?",
    "With bolts of bones, that fetter\u2019d stands",
    "In feet, and manacled in hands;",
    "Here blinded with an eye, and there",
    "Deaf with the drumming of an ear;",
    "A soul hung up, as \u2019twere, in chains",
    "Of nerves, and arteries, and veins;",
    "Tortur\u2019d, besides each other part,",
    "In a vain head, and double heart.",
    "O who shall me deliver whole",
    "From bonds of this tyrannic soul?",
    "Which, stretch\u2019d upright, impales me so",
    "That mine own precipice I go;",
    "And warms and moves this needless frame,",
    "(A fever could but do the same)",
    "And, wanting where its spite to try,",
    "Has made me live to let me die.",
    "A body that could never rest,",
    "Since this ill spirit it possest.",
    "What magic could me thus confine",
    "Within another\u2019s grief to pine?",
    "Where whatsoever it complain,",
    "I feel, that cannot feel, the pain;",
    "And all my care itself employs;",
    "That to preserve which me destroys;",
    "Constrain\u2019d not only to endure",
    "Diseases, but, what\u2019s worse, the cure;",
    "And ready oft the port to gain,",
    "Am shipwreck\u2019d into health again.",
    "But physic yet could never reach",
    "The maladies thou me dost teach;",
    "Whom first the cramp of hope does tear,",
    "And then the palsy shakes of fear;",
    "The pestilence of love does heat,",
    "Or hatred\u2019s hidden ulcer eat;",
    "Joy\u2019s cheerful madness does perplex,",
    "Or sorrow\u2019s other madness vex;",
    "Which knowledge forces me to know,",
    "And memory will not forego.",
    "What but a soul could have the wit",
    "To build me up for sin so fit?",
    "So architects do square and hew",
    "Green trees that in the forest grew."
