    "Her house is empty and her heart is old,",
    "And filled with shades and echoes that deceive",
    "No one save her, for still she tries to weave",
    "With blind bent fingers, nets that cannot hold.",
    "Once all men\u2019s arms rose up to her, \u2018tis told,",
    "And hovered like white birds for her caress:",
    "A crown she could have had to bind each tress",
    "Of hair, and her sweet arms the Witches\u2019 Gold.",
    "Her mirrors know her witnesses, for there",
    "She rose in dreams from other dreams that lent",
    "Her softness as she stood, crowned with soft hair.",
    "And with his bound heart and his young eyes bent",
    "And blind, he feels her presence like shed scent,",
    "Holding him body and life within its snare."
