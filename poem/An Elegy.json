    "Though beauty be the mark of praise,",
    "And yours of whom I sing be such",
    "As not the world can praise too much,",
    "Yet \u2019tis your virtue now I raise.",
    "A virtue, like allay, so gone",
    "Throughout your form, as, though that move",
    "And draw and conquer all men\u2019s love,",
    "This s\u00f9bjects you to love of one.",
    "Wherein you triumph yet; because",
    "\u2019Tis of yourself, and that you use",
    "The noblest freedom, not to choose",
    "Against or faith or honor\u2019s laws.",
    "But who should less expect from you,",
    "In whom alone Love lives again?",
    "By whom he is restored to men,",
    "And kept, and bred, and brought up true.",
    "His falling temples you have reared,",
    "The withered garlands ta\u2019en away;",
    "His altars kept from the decay",
    "That envy wished, and nature feared;",
    "And on them burn so chaste a flame,",
    "With so much loyalties\u2019 expense,",
    "As Love, t\u2019 acquit such excellence,",
    "Is gone himself into your name.",
    "And you are he; the deity",
    "To whom all lovers are designed",
    "That would their better objects find;",
    "Among which faithful troop am I.",
    "Who, as an offspring at your shrine,",
    "Have sung this hymn, and here entreat",
    "One spark of your diviner heat",
    "To light upon a love of mine.",
    "Which, if it kindle not, but scant",
    "Appear, and that to shortest view,",
    "Yet give me leave t\u2019 adore in you",
    "What I in her am grieved to want."
