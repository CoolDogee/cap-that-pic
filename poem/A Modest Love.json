    "The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall,",
    "The fly her spleen, the little sparks their heat;",
    "The slender hairs cast shadows, though but small,",
    "And bees have stings, although they be not great;",
    "Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;",
    "And love is love, in beggars as in kings.",
    "Where rivers smoothest run, deep are the fords;",
    "The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move;",
    "The firmest faith is in the fewest words;",
    "The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love:",
    "True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak;",
    "They hear and see, and sigh, and then they break."
