    "I have seen the Brown Recluse Spider",
    "run with a net in her hand, or rather,",
    "what resembled a net, what resembled",
    "a hand. She ran down the gleaming white floor",
    "of the bathtub, trailing a frail swirl",
    "of hair, and in it the hull of a beetle",
    "lay woven. The hair was my wife\u2019s,",
    "long and dark, a few loose strands, a curl",
    "she might idly have turned on a finger,",
    "she might idly have twisted, speaking to me,",
    "and the legs of the beetle were broken."
