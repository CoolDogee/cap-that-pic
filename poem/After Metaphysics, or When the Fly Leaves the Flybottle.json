    "Just when I\u2019m ready to call in the day and put it to bed without supper",
    "you send the mockingbird who plays with his musical zipper,",
    "exposing the World\u2019s underlife.",
    "You send purfume from the autumn olive",
    "whose septillion flowering ears are full of bees",
    "singing songs for the revolution.",
    "Out back Jake\u2019s Creek is speaking in tongues\u2014",
    "You wear me down, obsessively",
    "rubbing your hands along my better judgment,",
    "kissing the upturned noses of all my higher principles, until",
    "my clothes are big as a mast sail,",
    "until my longing leavens one thousand wedding cakes,",
    "my longing is an undertow, and all the tourist beaches are posted:",
    "Come for me\u2014I\u2019ll break off my arms and will them to a body",
    "of water, hang my legs up in overalls at night",
    "so they won\u2019t come after us, feed",
    "English to the birds in sweet pats of butter",
    "Then our loving gets raucous\u2014",
    "white moths yapping their wings\u2014you wag, you",
    "wag in the little fingerbowl of me.",
    "Your verbstem assumes declensions of mythic proportions.",
    "My vowel sounds open on the south-most",
    "side of the mountain.",
    "Then metaphysically speaking we\u2019ve stopped speaking",
    "metaphorically\u2014Silence",
    "nuanced as a landscape in snow."
