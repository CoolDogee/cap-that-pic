    "our labor the germ",
    "of later sustenance and renewal.",
    "Across the field the sound of a baby crying",
    "as we carry in the last carrots,",

    "late September sun streaming through",
    "the window, bread loaves and golden",
    "bunches of grapes on the table,",
    "spoonfuls of hot soup rising",
    "to our lips, filling us",
    "with what endures."
