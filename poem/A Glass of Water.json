    "Behind the wedding couple, a mirror harbours",
    "their reception.",
    "Outside, from the verandah, the harbour mirrors",
    "the exception",
    "of city from sky, hills snug with houses",
    "and a glass of water standing on the railing,",
    "half empty or half full. In the failing",
    "afternoon light",
    "brightening buildings counterpoint the darkness,",
    "glinting upside-",
    "down inside the glass, and the newly-weds,",
    "seen from outside",
    "joining hand to hand for the wedding reel,",
    "glide under its meniscus, head over heels."
