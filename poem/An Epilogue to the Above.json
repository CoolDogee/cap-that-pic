    "\u2018I pray\u2019\u2014said he\u2014\u2018when Queen Mab you do see",

    "And tell her I have heard Fame's loud report",
    "Both of her beauty and her stately court.\u2019",
    "When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,",
    "My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;",
    "Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,",
    "I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed;",
    "And then, in whispers soft, I did present",
    "His humble service which in mirth was sent;",
    "Thus by imagination I have been",
    "In Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen."
