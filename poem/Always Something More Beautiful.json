    "This time I came to the starting place",
    "with my best running shoes, and pure speed",
    "held back for the finish, came with only love",
    "of the clock and the underfooting",
    "and the other runners. Each of us would",
    "be testing excellence and endurance",
    "in the other, though in the past I\u2019d often",
    "veer off to follow some feral distraction",
    "down a side path, allowing myself",
    "to pursue something odd or beautiful,",
    "becoming acquainted with a few of the ways",
    "not to blame myself for failing to succeed.",
    "I had come to believe what\u2019s beautiful",
    "had more to do with daring",
    "to take yourself seriously, to stay",
    "the course, whatever the course might be.",
    "The person in front seemed ready to fade,",
    "his long, graceful stride shortening",
    "as I came up along his side. I was sure now",
    "I\u2019d at least exceed my best time.",
    "But the man with the famous final kick",
    "already had begun his move.",
    ", I heard",
    "a spectator say, as if something inevitable",
    "about to come from nowhere was again on its way."
