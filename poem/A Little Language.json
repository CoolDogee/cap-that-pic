    "I know a little language of my cat, though Dante says",
    "that animals have no need of speech and Nature",
    "abhors the superfluous. My cat is fluent. He",
    "converses when he wants with me. To speak",
    "is natural. And whales and wolves I\u2019ve heard",
    "in choral soundings of the sea and air",
    "know harmony and have an eloquence that stirs",
    "my mind and heart\u2014they touch the soul. Here",
    "Dante\u2019s religion that would set Man apart",
    "damns the effluence of our life from us",
    "to build therein its powerhouse.",
    "It\u2019s in his animal communication Man is",
    "true, immediate, and",
    "in immediacy, Man is all animal.",
    "His senses quicken in the thick of the symphony,",
    "old circuits of animal rapture and alarm,",
    "attentions and arousals in which an identity rearrives.",
    "He hears",
    "particular voices among",
    "the concert, the slightest",
    "rustle in the undertones,",
    "rehearsing a nervous aptitude",
    "yet to prove",
    "He sees the flick",
    "of significant red within the rushing mass",
    "of ruddy wilderness and catches the glow",
    "of a green shirt",
    "to delite him in a glowing field of green",
    "\u2014it",
    "to him\u2014",
    "and in the arc of the spectrum color",
    "speaks to color.",
    "The rainbow articulates",
    "a promise he remembers",
    "he but imitates",
    "in noises that he makes,",
    "this speech in every sense",
    "the world surrounding him.",
    "He picks up on the fugitive tang of mace",
    "amidst the savory mass,",
    "and taste in evolution is an everlasting key.",
    "There is a pun of scents in what makes sense.",
    "Myrrh it may have been,",
    "the odor of the announcement that filld the house.",
    "He wakes from deepest sleep",
    "upon a distant signal and waits",
    "as if crouching, springs",
    "to life."
