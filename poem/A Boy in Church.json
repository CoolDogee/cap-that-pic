    "\u2018Gabble-gabble, . . . brethren, . . . gabble-gabble!\u2019",
    "My window frames forest and heather.",
    "I hardly hear the tuneful babble,",
    "Not knowing nor much caring whether",
    "The text is praise or exhortation,",
    "Prayer or thanksgiving, or damnation.",
    "Outside it blows wetter and wetter,",
    "The tossing trees never stay still.",
    "I shift my elbows to catch better",
    "The full round sweep of heathered hill.",
    "The tortured copse bends to and fro",
    "In silence like a shadow-show.",
    "The parson\u2019s voice runs like a river",
    "Over smooth rocks, I like this church:",
    "The pews are staid, they never shiver,",
    "They never bend or sway or lurch.",
    "\u2018Prayer,\u2019 says the kind voice, \u2018is a chain",
    "That draws down Grace from Heaven again.\u2019",
    "I add the hymns up, over and over,",
    "Until there\u2019s not the least mistake.",
    "Seven-seventy-one. (Look! there\u2019s a plover!",
    "It\u2019s gone!) Who\u2019s that Saint by the lake?",
    "The red light from his mantle passes",
    "Across the broad memorial brasses.",
    "It\u2019s pleasant here for dreams and thinking,",
    "Lolling and letting reason nod,",
    "With ugly serious people linking",
    "Sad prayers to a forgiving God . . . .",
    "But a dumb blast sets the trees swaying",
    "With furious zeal like madmen praying."
