    "A fool I was to sleep at noon,",
    "And wake when night is chilly",
    "Beneath the comfortless cold moon;",
    "A fool to pluck my rose too soon,",
    "A fool to snap my lily.",
    "My garden-plot I have not kept;",
    "Faded and all-forsaken,",
    "I weep as I have never wept:",
    "Oh it was summer when I slept,",
    "It's winter now I waken.",
    "Talk what you please of future spring",
    "And sun-warm'd sweet to-morrow:\u0097",
    "Stripp'd bare of hope and everything,",
    "No more to laugh, no more to sing,",
    "I sit alone with sorrow."
