    "This is what our dying looks like.",
    "You believe in the sun. I believe",
    "I can't love you. Always be closing,",
    "Said our favorite professor before",
    "He let the gun go off in his mouth.",
    "I turned 29 the way any man turns",
    "In his sleep, unaware of the earth",
    "Moving beneath him, its plates in",
    "Their places, a dated disagreement.",
    "Let's fight it out, baby. You have",
    "Only so long left\u2014a man turning",
    "In his sleep\u2014so I take a picture.",
    "I won't look at it, of course. It's",
    "His bad side, his Mr. Hyde, the hole",
    "In a husband's head, the O",
    "Of his wife's mouth. Every night,",
    "I take a pill. Miss one, and I'm gone.",
    "Miss two, and we're through. Hotels",
    "Bore me, unless I get a mountain view,",
    "A room in which my cell won't work,",
    "And there's nothing to do but see",
    "The sun go down into the ground",
    "That cradles us as any coffin can."
