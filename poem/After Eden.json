    "Somewhere Zeno was smiling, the foul",
    "goblins of paradox were wearing",
    "their fairest clothes that night. My Dinner",
    "with a Chainsaw, the evening could have",
    "been called; and when one too many led",
    "to wise judgements too few, \u201cI\u2019m trying",
    "to break up with you!\u201d he shouted as",
    "stockings and scruples flew; and what was",
    "over wasn\u2019t; the brutal doings",
    "were sweeter than a caress; the thrill",
    "of it happening and the horror",
    "of it being an awful mistake",
    "collided like sweaty bodies in",
    "the dark, disheveled room. So this is",
    "moving on, she reflected after",
    "he left. But what was motion? No straight",
    "bright line but a wind every bit as",
    "stormy as the people it carried",
    "away from safety, through towns that froze",
    "and burned, helping them forward but not",
    "letting them forget for a second",
    "their ceaseless looking for what is lost,",
    "their sad resemblance to the quick and",
    "stubborn arrows that never arrive."
