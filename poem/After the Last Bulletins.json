    "After the last bulletins the windows darken",
    "And the whole city founders readily and deep,",
    "Sliding on all its pillows",
    "To the thronged Atlantis of personal sleep,",
    "And the wind rises. The wind rises and bowls",
    "The day\u2019s litter of news in the alleys. Trash",
    "Tears itself on the railings,",
    "Soars and falls with a soft crash,",
    "Tumbles and soars again. Unruly flights",
    "Scamper the park, and taking a statue for dead",
    "Strike at the positive eyes,",
    "Batter and flap the stolid head",
    "And scratch the noble name. In empty lots",
    "Our journals spiral in a fierce noyade",
    "Of all we thought to think,",
    "Or caught in corners cramp and wad",
    "And twist our words. And some from gutters flail",
    "Their tatters at the tired patrolman\u2019s feet,",
    "Like all that fisted snow",
    "That cried beside his long retreat",
    "Damn you! damn you! to the emperor\u2019s horse\u2019s heels.",
    "Oh none too soon through the air white and dry",
    "Will the clear announcer\u2019s voice",
    "Beat like a dove, and you and I",
    "From the heart\u2019s anarch and responsible town",
    "Return by subway-mouth to life again,",
    "Bearing the morning papers,",
    "And cross the park where saintlike men,",
    "White and absorbed, with stick and bag remove",
    "The litter of the night, and footsteps rouse",
    "With confident morning sound",
    "The songbirds in the public boughs."
