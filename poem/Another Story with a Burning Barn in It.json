    "I was on the porch pinching back the lobelia",
    "like trimming a great blue head of hair.",
    "We\u2019d just planted the near field, the far one",
    "the day before. I\u2019d never seen it so clear,",
    "so gusty, so overcast, so clear, so calm.",
    "They say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster,",
    "and that morning I happened to remember,",
    "so I put them on for milking, finding some",
    "sympathy, I guess, between the two.",
    "Usually I don\u2019t sit down until much later in the day.",
    "The lobelia was curling in the sun. One by one",
    "birds flew off, and that should have been a sign.",
    "Trust is made and broken. I hardly sit down",
    "at all. It was the time of year for luna moths,",
    "but we hadn\u2019t had any yet settling on the porch",
    "or hovering above the garden I\u2019d let the wild rose take."
