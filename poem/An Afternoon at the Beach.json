    "I\u2019ll go among the dead to see my friend.",
    "The place I leave is beautiful: the sea",
    "Repeats the winds\u2019 far swell in its long sound,",
    "And, there beside it, houses solemnly",
    "Shine with the modest courage of the land,",
    "While swimmers try the verge of what they see.",
    "I cannot go, although I should pretend",
    "Some final self whose phantom eye could see",
    "Him who because he is not cannot change.",
    "And yet the thought of going makes the sea,",
    "The land, the swimmers, and myself seem strange,",
    "Almost as strange as they will someday be."
