    "\u2019Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro\u2019 the house,",
    "Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;",
    "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,",
    "In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;",
    "The children were nestled all snug in their beds,",
    "While visions of sugar plums danc\u2019d in their heads,",
    "And Mama in her \u2018kerchief, and I in my cap,",
    "Had just settled our brains for a long winter\u2019s nap \u2014",
    "When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,",
    "I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.",
    "Away to the window I flew like a flash,",
    "Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.",
    "The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,",
    "Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below;",
    "When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,",
    "But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer,",
    "With a little old driver, so lively and quick,",
    "I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.",
    "More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,",
    "And he whistled, and shouted, and call\u2019d them by name:",
    "\u201cNow! Dasher, now! Dancer, now! Prancer, and Vixen,",
    "\u201cOn! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Dunder and Blixem;",
    "\u201cTo the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!",
    "\u201cNow dash away! dash away! dash away all!\u201d",
    "As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,",
    "When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;",
    "So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,",
    "With the sleigh full of Toys \u2014 and St. Nicholas too:",
    "And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof",
    "The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.",
    "As I drew in my head, and was turning around,",
    "Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:",
    "He was dress\u2019d all in fur, from his head to his foot,",
    "And his clothes were all tarnish\u2019d with ashes and soot;",
    "A bundle of toys was flung on his back,",
    "And he look\u2019d like a peddler just opening his pack:",
    "His eyes \u2014 how they twinkled! his dimples how merry,",
    "His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;",
    "His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow.",
    "And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;",
    "The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,",
    "And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.",
    "He had a broad face, and a little round belly",
    "That shook when he laugh\u2019d, like a bowl full of jelly:",
    "He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,",
    "And I laugh\u2019d when I saw him in spite of myself;",
    "A wink of his eye and a twist of his head",
    "Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.",
    "He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,",
    "And fill\u2019d all the stockings; then turn\u2019d with a jerk,",
    "And laying his finger aside of his nose",
    "And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.",
    "He sprung to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,",
    "And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle:",
    "But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight \u2014",
    "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night."
