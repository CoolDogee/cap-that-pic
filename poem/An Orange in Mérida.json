    "The orange-peelers of M\u00e9rida, in the wrought-",
    "iron midday, come with mechanical skewers",
    "and live oranges, to straddle the paths",
    "on caissons of bicycle wheels",
    "and work in the dark of the plaza, like jewelers\u2019 cloths.",
    "The orange is ceremonious. Its sleep",
    "is Egyptian. Its golden umbilicus",
    "waits in pyramidal light, swath over swath, outwitting",
    "the Caesars. It cannot be ravaged by knives,",
    "but clasps its mortality in, like the skein of an asp.",
    "The bandstand glitters like bone, in laurel",
    "and spittle. Behind their triangular",
    "catafalques, the orange-peelers move through the thirst",
    "of the world with Rameses\u2019 bounty",
    "caulked into the hive of the peel",
    "while ratchets and wheels spin a blazing",
    "cosmology on their little machines. Under",
    "skewers and handles, the orange\u2019s skin",
    "is pierced, the orange, in chain-mail and papyrus,",
    "unwinds the graveclothes of Pharaoh",
    "in a helix of ribbon, unflawed, from the navel\u2019s",
    "knot to the rind and the pulp underneath, like a butterfly\u2019s",
    "chrysalis. And sleeper by sleeper, the living turn with their thirst",
    "to each other, the orange\u2019s pith is broken",
    "in a blind effervescence that perfumes the palate and burns",
    "to the tooth\u2019s bite.",
    "And the dead reawaken."
