    "No, this is not my life, thank God ...",
    "... worn out like this, and crippled by brain-fag;",
    "Obsessed first by one person, and then",
    "(Almost at once) most horribly besotted by another;",
    "These Februaries, full of draughts and cracks,",
    "They belong to the people in the streets, the others",
    "Out there \u2013 haberdashers, writers of menus.",
    "Barometers, full of contempt, controlling moody isobars.",
    "Sumptuous tittle-tattle from a summer crowd",
    "That\u2019s fed on lemonades and matin\u00e9es. And seas",
    "That float themselves about from place to place, and then",
    "Spend",
    "Yalta: deck-chairs in Asia\u2019s gold cake; thrones.",
    "Inside their draughty haberdasher\u2019s climate,",
    "With these people ... who are going to obsess me,",
    "Potatoes, dentists, people I hardly know, it\u2019s unforgivable",
    "For this is not my life",
    "And I wolf, bolt, gulp it down, day after day."
