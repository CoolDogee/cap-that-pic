    "A heritage of a sort.",
    "A heritage of comradeship and suffocation.",
    "The bawling pit-hooter and the god\u2019s",
    "explosive foray, vengeance, before retreating",
    "to his throne of sulphur.",
    "Now this black-robed god of fossils",
    "and funerals,",
    "petrifier of underground forests",
    "and flowers,",
    "emerges with his grim retinue",
    "past a pony\u2019s skeleton, past human skulls,",
    "into his half-propped up, empty, carbon colony.",
    "Above, on the brutalised,",
    "unstitched side of a Welsh mountain,",
    "it has to be someone from somewhere else",
    "who will sing solo",
    "not of the marasmus of the Valleys,",
    "the pit-wheels that do not turn,",
    "the pump-house abandoned;",
    "nor of how, after a half-mile fall",
    "regiments of miners\u2019 lamps",
    "no longer, midge-like,",
    "rise and slip and bob.",
    "Only someone uncommitted,",
    "someone from somewhere else,",
    "panorama-high on a coal-tip,",
    "may jubilantly laud",
    "the re-entry of the exiled god",
    "into his shadowless kingdom.",
    "He, drunk with methane,",
    "raising a man\u2019s femur like a sceptre;",
    "she, his ravished queen,",
    "admiring the blood-stained black roses",
    "that could not thrive on the plains of Enna."
