    "1. DELIRIUM, AFTER RIMBAUD",
    "How many hours I kept",
    "that vigil by your side\u2014",
    "entire nights, eyes wide,",
    "as you so sweetly slept.",
    "What I was wondering:",
    "why you yearned to evade",
    "the real. No one has prayed",
    "harder for anything.",
    "It wasn\u2019t for your life",
    "I feared, but for mankind.",
    "Did you, in the end, find",
    "secrets for",
    "?",
    "2. DEFACED, AFTER RILKE",
    "The head we cannot know,",
    "nor its bright fruit, the eyes.",
    "And yet the body has",
    "its gaze: a lamp turned low.",
    "Or else the breast would cease",
    "to dazzle, the hips fail",
    "to curve into that smile",
    "that begets more than a kiss.",
    "And flesh would lose all life,",
    "not flare till there\u2019s no blind",
    "it can\u2019t see",
    "behind.",
    "You must change your life.",
    "3. DENIAL, AFTER SEFERIS",
    "The afternoon grew hotter",
    "along our secret shore.",
    "We thirsted in the glare",
    "but couldn\u2019t drink the water.",
    "On golden sand we traced",
    "your name beside the sea.",
    "The wind came like a sigh;",
    "our writing was erased.",
    "How passionate our life,",
    "how full of sex and song,",
    "spirit and heart\u2014how wrong!",
    "And so we changed our life."
