    "Out of the cracks of cups and their handles, missing,",
    "the leaves unceremoniously tossed, unread,",
    "from a stubble of coffee ground ever more finely",
    "into these hollowed grounds,",
    "the first shift coaxes bulldozers to life,",
    "sphinxes to tease the riddled rubble",
    "into fresh pyramids of rot. A staleness warms enough",
    "to waft round the lord of all purveyed.",
    "His to count the hauls past the yawning gates",
    "of this New Giza into the Middle Kingdom\u2019s",
    "Late Intermediate Period. There, to purify,",
    "to honor ourselves, we beg these offerings",
    "of refuse be cast out. To the archaeologist",
    "of the far-flung future, enough evidence",
    "in the inscriptions to identify most owners:",
    "spells scratched on the backs of envelopes",
    "to be read out before animal sacrifice,",
    "the",
    "and",
    "joined in this hereafter with the feast\u2019s remains.",
    "Over tomatoes splitting their sides,",
    "over a teacup stained with roses",
    "flattened into mosaic petal from petal,",
    "earthmovers move a little mountain",
    "and, having moved it, move on,",
    "overturning a diamond sprung from its ring,",
    "glitter to a magpie\u2019s covetous eye.",
    "If the art of loneliness is landscape,",
    "armload by carload of black-bagged leaves,",
    "landfill contours its likeness."
