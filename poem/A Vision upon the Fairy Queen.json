    "Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,",
    "Within that temple where the vestal flame",
    "Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,",
    "To see that buried dust of living fame,",
    "Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:",
    "All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;",
    "At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,",
    "And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:",
    "For they this queen attended; in whose stead",
    "Oblivion laid him down on Laura\u2019s hearse:",
    "Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,",
    "And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:",
    "Where Homer\u2019s spright did tremble all for grief,",
    "And cursed the access of that celestial thief!"
