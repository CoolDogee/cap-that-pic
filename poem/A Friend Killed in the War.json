    "Night, the fat serpent, slipped among the plants,",
    "Intent upon the apples of his eyes;",
    "A heavy bandoleer hung like a prize",
    "Around his neck, and tropical red ants",
    "Mounted his body, and he heard advance,",
    "Little by little, the thin female cries",
    "Of mortar shells. He thought of Paradise.",
    "Such is the vision that extremity grants.",
    "In the clean brightness of magnesium",
    "Flares, there were seven angels by a tree.",
    "Their hair flashed diamonds, and they made him doubt",
    "They were not really from Elysium.",
    "And his flesh opened like a peony,",
    "Red at the heart, white petals furling out."
