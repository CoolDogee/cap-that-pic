    "He faced the sink, one foot up",
    "on the edge of the tub. She stood",
    "behind him, reaching around.",
    "In the mirror, her face rose",
    "over his shoulder like the moon,",
    "and like the moon she regarded him",
    "beautifully but without feeling,",
    "and he looked at her as he would",
    "at the moon:",
    "No smiling, no weeping,",
    "no talking. A man and a woman",
    "transacting their magnificent business",
    "with the usual equanimity. The man",
    "as a passenger walking the ship\u2019s deck",
    "at evening and the woman as the moon",
    "over his shoulder oiling the ocean",
    "with light. Deep in the ship\u2019s belly",
    "pistons churned and sailors fed",
    "the boilers' roar with coal. On deck",
    "just the engine\u2019s dull thrum and",
    "a faint click as the woman sets her ring",
    "on the cool white lip of the sink."
