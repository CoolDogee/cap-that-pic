    "Arp might have done a version in white marble,",
    "the model held aloft, in approximate awe:",
    "this tough cross-section oval of tusk,",
    "dense and cool as fossil cranium\u0097",
    "preliminary bloodshed condonable",
    "if Inupiat hunters on King Island may",
    "follow as their fathers did the bark of a husky,",
    "echoes ricocheted from roughed-up eskers",
    "on the glacier, a resonance salt-cured",
    "and stained deep green by Arctic seas, whose tilting floor",
    "mirrors the mainland\u2019s snowcapped amphitheater.",
    "Which of his elders set Mike Saclamana the task",
    "and taught him to decide, in scrimshaw, what was so?",
    "Netted incisions black as an etching",
    "saw a way to scratch in living infinitives",
    "known since the Miocene to have animated",
    "the Bering Strait: one humpback whale, plump,",
    "and bardic; an orca caught on the ascending arc,",
    "salt droplets flung from a flange of soot-black fin ...",
    "Farther along the bone conveyor belt a small",
    "ringed seal will never not be swimming, part-time",
    "landlubber, who may feel overshadowed by the donor",
    "walrus ahead. And by his scribal tusk, which stands",
    "in direct correspondence to the draftsman\u2019s burin,",
    "skillful enough to score their tapeloop ostinato,",
    "no harp sonata, but, instead, the humpback whale\u2019s",
    "yearning bassoon (still audible if you cup",
    "the keepsake to your ear and let it sound the depths)."
