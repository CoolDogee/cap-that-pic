    "It is pleasant, very pleasant, to sit at a wooden booth",
    "surrounded by parrots, wheels, right-turning conch shells,",
    "the victory banner and the endless knot,",
    "the lotus, the treasure vase, the golden fishes\u2014",
    "is this not so? Is it not pleasant",
    "to sip Tsingtao beer, or Zhujiang, or Yanjing,",
    "and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats?",
    "After we\u2019ve drunk enough, there will be Buddhist Delight,",
    "Mongolian beef side dishes, a whole host of sauces,",
    "even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present,",
    "as well as the small ice-cream machine, lotus paste, pears,",
    "smiles and bows all around. It is pleasant, is it not,",
    "to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lot",
    "of this small strip mall beside this secondary road",
    "and look upon the scattered cars all come to rest here",
    "like boats in China, floating on a quiet evening tide."
