    "I that have been a lover, and could show it,",
    "Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,",
    "Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become",
    "A better lover, and much better poet.",
    "Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it",
    "To those true numerous graces, whereof some",
    "But charm the senses, others overcome",
    "Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:",
    "For in your verse all Cupid\u2019s armory,",
    "His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,",
    "His very eyes are yours to overthrow.",
    "But then his mother\u2019s sweets you so apply,",
    "Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take",
    "For Venus\u2019 ceston every line you make."
