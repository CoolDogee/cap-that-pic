    "A Girl,",
    "Her soul a deep-wave pearl",
    "Dim, lucent of all lovely mysteries;",
    "A face flowered for heart\u2019s ease,",
    "A brow\u2019s grace soft as seas",
    "Seen through faint forest-trees:",
    "A mouth, the lips apart,",
    "Like aspen-leaflets trembling in the breeze",
    "From her tempestuous heart.",
    "Such: and our souls so knit,",
    "I leave a page half-writ \u2014",
    "The work begun",
    "Will be to heaven\u2019s conception done,",
    "If she come to it."
