    "When she came into his room he was asleep",
    "and when she touched him, he woke\u2014",
    "her hand on his shoulder, her knee at his mouth,",
    "and in the darkness, she looked like a boy.",
    "When he tried to sit up she covered his ears",
    "with her hands: \u201cSave ourselves from ourselves,\u201d",
    "she said, and then a wind stirred in the room",
    "as if she\u2019d placed those words in his mouth."
