    "From embarrassment, I made statements.",
    "My icons\u2014tight caves and mouths\u2014stuck together",
    "briefly like dry lips, like a lover\u2019s insults.",
    "The fact is they were ugly to all of us.",
    "I said, How painstakingly personal!",
    "Here are the words for this,",
    "Relentless as insects! I was hysterical.",
    "Every tone became artful,",
    "the worst urges nuzzling like housepets",
    "for someone to feel them, each real subject",
    "demanding more real context for remarks.",
    "Then abstractions insinuating their sharp edges,",
    "asking to pry open privacies",
    "alone in the bathroom at bedtime",
    "then with strangers in elevators, at stop signs.",
    "Even then, I knew you\u2019d shun them,",
    "because who would choose such intrusions?",
    "I learned to love this isolation",
    "as a woman who appears to listen.",
    "All night I\u2019d talk about my life",
    "anticipating her dramatic relief,",
    "believing her affectionate gestures filled in",
    "what wasn\u2019t spoken. At those times",
    "she seemed so genuine and friendly,",
    "a voice from inside my own body",
    "describing my shameless surrender",
    "as our first kiss, perfect as gravity."
