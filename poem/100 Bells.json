    "My sister died. He raped me. They beat me. I fell",
    "to the floor. I didn\u2019t. I knew children,",
    "their smallness. Her corpse. My fingernails.",
    "The softness of my belly, how it could",
    "double over. It was puckered, like children,",
    "ugly when they cry. My sister died",
    "and was revived. Her brain burst",
    "into blood. Father was driving. He fell",
    "asleep. They beat me. I didn\u2019t flinch. I did.",
    "It was the only dance I knew.",
    "It was the kathak. My ankles sang",
    "with 100 bells. The stranger",
    "raped me on the fitted sheet.",
    "I didn\u2019t scream. I did not know",
    "better. I knew better. I did not",
    "live. My father said, I will go to jail",
    "tonight because I will kill you. I said,",
    "She died. It was the kathakali. Only men",
    "were allowed to dance it. I threw",
    "a chair at my mother. I ran from her.",
    "The kitchen. The flyswatter was",
    "a whip. The flyswatter was a flyswatter.",
    "I was thrown into a fire ant bed. I wanted to be",
    "a man. It was summer in Texas and dry.",
    "I burned. It was a snake dance.",
    "He said, Now I\u2019ve seen a Muslim girl",
    "naked. I held him to my chest. I held her",
    "because I didn\u2019t know it would be",
    "the last time. I threw no",
    "punches. I threw a glass box into a wall.",
    "Somebody is always singing. Songs",
    "were not allowed. Mother said,",
    "Dance and the bells will sing with you.",
    "I slithered. Glass beneath my feet. I",
    "locked the door. I did not",
    "die. I shaved my head. Until the horns",
    "I knew were there were visible.",
    "Until the doorknob went silent."
