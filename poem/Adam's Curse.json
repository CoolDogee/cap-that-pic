    "We sat together at one summer\u2019s end,",
    "That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,",
    "And you and I, and talked of poetry.",
    "I said, \u2018A line will take us hours maybe;",
    "Yet if it does not seem a moment\u2019s thought,",
    "Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.",
    "Better go down upon your marrow-bones",
    "And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones",
    "Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;",
    "For to articulate sweet sounds together",
    "Is to work harder than all these, and yet",
    "Be thought an idler by the noisy set",
    "Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen",
    "The martyrs call the world.\u2019",
    "And thereupon",
    "That beautiful mild woman for whose sake",
    "There\u2019s many a one shall find out all heartache",
    "On finding that her voice is sweet and low",
    "Replied, \u2018To be born woman is to know\u2014",
    "Although they do not talk of it at school\u2014",
    "That we must labour to be beautiful.\u2019",
    "I said, \u2018It\u2019s certain there is no fine thing",
    "Since Adam\u2019s fall but needs much labouring.",
    "There have been lovers who thought love should be",
    "So much compounded of high courtesy",
    "That they would sigh and quote with learned looks",
    "Precedents out of beautiful old books;",
    "Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.\u2019",
    "We sat grown quiet at the name of love;",
    "We saw the last embers of daylight die,",
    "And in the trembling blue-green of the sky",
    "A moon, worn as if it had been a shell",
    "Washed by time\u2019s waters as they rose and fell",
    "About the stars and broke in days and years.",
    "I had a thought for no one\u2019s but your ears:",
    "That you were beautiful, and that I strove",
    "To love you in the old high way of love;",
    "That it had all seemed happy, and yet we\u2019d grown",
    "As weary-hearted as that hollow moon."
