    "It was the summer of 1976 when I saw the moon fall down.",
    "It broke like a hen\u2019s egg on the sidewalk.",
    "The garden roiled with weeds, hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my",
    "oblivious siblings.",
    "A gush of yolk and then darker.",
    "Somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a Chevy Impala\u2014vinyl seats, the rear- view,",
    "headrests and you, your hand through your hair.",
    "Because the earth\u2019s core was cooling, all animals felt the urge to wander.",
    "Wash down this whisper of you, the terrible must.",
    "Maybe the core wasn\u2019t cooling, but I felt a coolness in my mother.",
    "That girl was shining me on.",
    "In blue crayon, the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room.",
    "I wrote the word LAVA on my jeans.",
    ", I sang with the 8-track.",
    "But the moon had not broken on the sidewalk, the moon",
    "was hot, bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door,",
    "and that serious night cooled, settling",
    "like sugar on our lawn.",
    "I wrote the word SUGAR on my palms.",
    ".",
    "The moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair."
