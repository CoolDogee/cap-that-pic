    "Being unwise enough to have married her",
    "I never knew when she was not acting.",

    "Sigh. \u2018I hate you\u2019; I could never be sure",
    "They were still there. She was lovely. I",
    "Was only the looking-glass she made up in.",
    "I husbanded the rippling meadow",
    "Of her body. Their eyes grazed nightly upon it.",
    "Alone now on the brittle platform",
    "Of herself she is playing her last r\u00f4le.",
    "It is perfect. Never in all her career",
    "Was she so good. And yet the curtain",
    "Has fallen. My charmer, come out from behind",
    "It to take the applause. Look, I am clapping too."
