    "May it please Lord Elgin, Earl of Kincardine,",
    "to consider the undersign\u2019d, sole author",
    "and inventor of the Eidophusikon,",
    "for the position so lately rejected",
    "by Mr. Turner. On giving the measure",
    "of its Effects\u2014calm & storm both, sunset",
    "or moonlight, the accurate imitation",
    "of Nature\u2019s sounds: approaching thunder, the dash",
    "of waves on a pebbly beach, the distant gun\u2014",
    "my Device was pronounc\u2019d by no less a judge",
    "than Richard Wilson, R.A.\u2014the same who cried out",
    "at the sight of Terni Cascade, \u201cO well done,",
    "water, by God!\u201d\u2014was pronounc\u2019d, I say, by him",
    "\u201chighly successful in agitated seas,\u201d",
    "by reason of the high finish carrying",
    "severally their satellites of color",
    "into the very center of the Pictures.",
    "As it happens, your Lordship, I visited",
    "the same Joseph Turner known to your Lordship",
    "(I believe) only this week, and found a man",
    "pacing to and fro before his pale muslin",
    "on which the sick and wan Sun, in all the doubt",
    "of darkness, was not allow\u2019d to shed one ray,",
    "but tears. Even as he work\u2019d, pouring wet paint",
    "onto paper till it was saturated,",
    "then tore, then scratch\u2019d, then scrubb\u2019d in a frenzy",
    "at the sheet, the Whole being chaos, until",
    "as if by enchantment, the Scene appear\u2019d then,",
    "great ships gone to pieces in order to fling",
    "magical oranges on the waves\u2014but I",
    "digress: even as he shew\u2019d me two books fill\u2019d",
    "with studies from Nature, several tinted",
    "on the spot\u2014which he found, he said, much the most",
    "valuable to him\u2014this Turner discuss\u2019d",
    "the present urgency of your Lordship\u2019s need",
    "for an artist who might draw Antiquities,",
    "with suitable finish, before Removal,",
    "by your Lordship\u2019s design, from Athens. He said",
    "he could not, himself, endure the Ideal,",
    "but enjoy\u2019d and look\u2019d for only",
    "\u2014why",
    "even his richest vegetation is confus\u2019d,",
    "he delights in shingle, debris and mere heaps",
    "of fallen stone. Upon communicating",
    "the intelligence that your Lordship\u2019s stipend",
    "must include assistance to Lady Elgin",
    "in decorating fire-screens and the like,",
    "the man turn\u2019d back in some heat to his labor",
    "upon what I took to be that mysterious",
    "forest below London Bridge, where great ships ride,",
    "sails filling or falling, disorder\u2019d too",
    "by the stress of anchorage, all beautiful",
    "though wild beneath the Daemonic pressure",
    "of his inquiry (with so much of the trowel,",
    "surely a touch more",
    "might be borne!).",
    "Enough of Turner, I have not to speak here",
    "of him, though what I saw was but the",
    "of Painting, surely. What I would say is this:",
    "I venture to suggest in myself a man",
    "your Lordship, and my Lady, most certainly,",
    "might rely upon for accurate Service,",
    "work of a conclusive polish, not a sketch.",
    "There is, may I make so bold, a point at which",
    "in Turner\u2019s Picturesque, as Fuseli says,",
    "two spiders, caressing or killing each other,",
    "must have greatly the advantage, in roughness",
    "of surface and intricacy of motion,",
    "over every athletic or am\u2019rous",
    "Symplegma left by the Ancients. I do not",
    "wish to speak further of the man who renounc\u2019d",
    "your Lordship\u2019s commission to copy marbles,",
    "muttering (though plain to hear), \u201cAntiquities",
    "be damn\u2019d, by Thames\u2019 shore we will die,\u201d and went on",
    "raking at the sea with his untidy thumb;",
    "but only to call your Lordship\u2019s kind notice",
    "and gracious favor, for the appointed task,",
    "to the creator of the Eidophusikon,",
    "these many years a loyal British subject,",
