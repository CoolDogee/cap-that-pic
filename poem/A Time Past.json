    "The old wooden steps to the front door",
    "where I was sitting that fall morning",
    "when you came downstairs, just awake,",
    "and my joy at sight of you (emerging",
    "into golden day\u2014",
    "the dew almost frost)",
    "pulled me to my feet to tell you",
    "how much I loved you:",
    "those wooden steps",
    "are gone now, decayed",
    "replaced with granite,",
    "hard, gray, and handsome.",
    "The old steps live",
    "only in me:",
    "my feet and thighs",
    "remember them, and my hands",
    "still feel their splinters.",
    "Everything else about and around that house",
    "brings memories of others\u2014of marriage,",
    "of my son. And the steps do too: I recall",
    "sitting there with my friend and her little son who died,",
    "or was it the second one who lives and thrives?",
    "And sitting there \u2018in my life,\u2019 often, alone or with my husband.",
    "Yet that one instant,",
    "your cheerful, unafraid, youthful, \u2018I love you too,\u2019",
    "the quiet broken by no bird, no cricket, gold leaves",
    "spinning in silence down without",
    "any breeze to blow them,",
    "is what twines itself",
    "in my head and body across those slabs of wood",
    "that were warm, ancient, and now",
    "wait somewhere to be burnt."
