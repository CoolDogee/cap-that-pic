    "Angels are unthinkable",
    "in hot weather",
    "except in some tropical locales, where",
    "from time to time, the women catch one in their nets,",
    "hang it dry, and fashion it into a lantern",
    "that will burn forever on its own inexhaustible oils.",
    "But here\u2014shins smocked with heat rash,",
    "the supersaturated air. We no longer believe",
    "in energies pure enough not to carry heat,",
    "nor in connections\u2014the thought of someone",
    "somewhere warming the air we breathe",
    "that one degree more . . . .",
    "In a packed pub during the World Cup final,",
    "a bony redhead woman gripped my arm",
    "too hard.",
    "Like a child\u2019s perfect outline in fast-melting snow,",
    "her wet handprint on my skin, disappearing.",
    "The crowd boiling over, a steam jet:",
    "And Paris\u2014a heroin addict",
    "who put her hypodermic",
    "to my throat:",
    "Grabbing her wrist, I saw",
    "her forearm\u2019s tight net sleeve of drying blood.",
    "I don\u2019t like to be touched.",
    "I stand in this mammoth parking lot,",
    "car doors open, letting the air conditioner",
    "run for a while before getting in.",
    "The heat presses down equally",
    "everywhere. It wants to focus itself,",
    "to vaporize something instantaneously,",
    "efficiently\u2014that shopping cart, maybe,",
    "or that half-crushed brown-glass bottle\u2014",
    "but can\u2019t quite. Asphalt softens in the sun.",
    "Nothing\u2019s detachable.",
    "The silvery zigzag line",
    "stitching the tarmac to the sky around the edges",
    "is no breeze, just a trick of heat.",
    "My splayed-out compact car half-sunk",
    "in the tar pit of its own shadow\u2014",
    "strong-shouldered, straining",
    "to lift its vestigial wings."
