    "Had I remained in innocent security,",
    "I should have thought all men were born my slaves,",
    "And worn my power like lightning in my eyes,",
    "To have destroyed at pleasure when offended.",
    "\u2014But when love held the mirror, the undeceiving glass",
    "Reflected all the weakness of my soul, and made me know",
    "My richest treasure being lost, my honour,",
    "All the remaining spoil could not be worth",
    "The conqueror\u2019s care or value.",
    "\u2014Oh how I fell like a long worshipped idol",
    "Discovering all the cheat."
