    "All afternoon the shadows have been building",
    "A city of their own within the streets,",
    "Carefully correcting the perspectives",
    "With dark diagonals, and paring back",
    "Sidewalks into catwalks, strips of bright",
    "Companionways, as if it were a ship",
    "This counter-city. But the leaning, black",
    "Enjambements like ladders for assault",
    "Scale the fa\u00e7ade and tie them to the earth,",
    "Confounding fire-escapes already meshed",
    "In slatted ambiguities. You touch",
    "The sliding shapes to find which place is which",
    "And grime a finger with the ash of time",
    "That blows through both, the shadow in the shade",
    "And in the light, that scours each thoroughfare",
    "To pit the walls, rise out of yard and stairwell",
    "And tarnish the Chrysler\u2019s Aztec pinnacle."
