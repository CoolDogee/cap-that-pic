    "For seventeen years I was caught in the surf.",
    "Drubbed and scoured, I\u2019d snatch a breath",
    "and be jerked down again, dragged across",
    "broken shells and shingle. I loved it,",
    "mostly, the need, how I fed the frantic.",
    "I\u2019d skipped into that sea. Certainly not",
    "a girl, but I could still turn a head as I took",
    "the foam between my thighs.",
    "Then it was over.",
    "Hiss of a match",
    "snuffed with spit. The sea had trotted off.",
    "I stood in the stink of flapping fish.",
    "At first it stung. A galaxy of dimes",
    "eyed my sag and crinkles and dismissed",
    "me like a canceled stamp,",
    "but something tugged at me, silver braids",
    "weaving and unweaving themselves",
    "and either the path was shrinking",
    "or I was getting bigger, for soon the way",
    "was just a hair, the extra bit of wit",
    "a grandma leaves on her chin",
    "to scare the boys, and it led me",
    "into a cave crackling like a woodstove",
    "with laughter.",
    "A landslide opened",
    "a seam of rubies and we stepped inside."
