    "The Visconti put you on their flag: a snake",
    "devouring a child, or are you throwing up a man",
    "feet first? Some snakes hunt frogs, some freedom of will.",
    "There\u2019s good in you: a man can count years on your skin.",
    "Generously, you mother and father a stolen boy,",
    "to the chosen you offer your cake of figs.",
    "A goiter on my neck, you lick my ear with lies,",
    "yet I must listen, smile and kiss your cheek",
    "or you may swallow the child completely. In Milan",
    "there is a triptych, the throned Virgin in glory,",
    "placed on the marble below, a dead naked man",
    "and a giant dead frog of human scale on its back.",
    "There\u2019s hope! My eyes look into the top of my head",
    "at the wreath of snakes that sometimes crowns me."
