    "There is a change\u0097and I am poor;",
    "Your love hath been, nor long ago,",
    "A fountain at my fond heart's door,",
    "Whose only business was to flow;",
    "And flow it did; not taking heed",
    "Of its own bounty, or my need.",
    "What happy moments did I count!",
    "Blest was I then all bliss above!",
    "Now, for that consecrated fount",
    "Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,",
    "What have I? shall I dare to tell?",
    "A comfortless and hidden well.",
    "A well of love\u0097it may be deep\u0097",
    "I trust it is,\u0097and never dry:",
    "What matter? if the waters sleep",
    "In silence and obscurity.",
    "\u0097Such change, and at the very door",
    "Of my fond heart, hath made me poor."
