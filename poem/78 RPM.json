    "In the back of the junkhouse",
    "stacked on a cardtable covered",
    "by a ragged bedspread, they rest,",
    "black platters whose music once",
    "crackled, hissed with a static",
    "like shuffling feet, fox trot or two-step,",
    "the slow dance of the needle",
    "riding its merry-go-round,",
    "my mother\u2019s head nestled",
    "on my father\u2019s shoulder as they",
    "turned, lost in the sway of sounds,",
    "summer nights and faraway",
    "places, the syncopation of time",
    "waltzing them to a world",
    "they never dreamed, dance",
    "of then to the dust of now."
