    "The stroll from my cell",
    "along the path above the donkeys",
    "past a door open, a door shut",
    "and a strong smell of wood",
    "and cigarettes ends where",
    "music helps white marguerites",
    "cut through the masonry.",

    "Dark for words with a clicking wren",
    "a yellow tit and over the clover a",
    "shovel and a rustle of grain.",
    "He\u2019s training calves with shouts and food",
    "to follow him to another field",
    "before the second bell.",
    "*",
    "Broom loops over the buttercups.",
    "These names",
    "give birth to cones and needles, ferns",
    "with mini-sacs of pollen attached.",
    "It only takes one shot of spittle on green",
    "for my brother to explain the sexual life",
    "of the forest and honeybees.",

    "Simon says he would like to live alone",
    "in a cottage with a garden,",
    "no humans, no obligations. Solitary",

    "outside our habitats.",

    "or syrup in the lower veins.",
    "*",
    "I hate the thistledown",
    "covering my prototype now",
    "interior layer cowering at power",
    "or shout, but can laugh",
    "with the one who has sap under",
    "his skin pouring the bucket",
    "the hand is carrying.",

    "Brother, help me find an animal",

    "would be wonderful.",
    "A sigh without the ghostly gasps",
    "that accompany a certain voice.",

    "of the kind no one can see or hear.",

    "more like the breathy Saint Bernard.",
    "But a little dog",
    "A cask of brandy hanging at his neck"
