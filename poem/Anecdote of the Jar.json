    "I placed a jar in Tennessee,",
    "And round it was, upon a hill.",
    "It made the slovenly wilderness",
    "Surround that hill.",
    "The wilderness rose up to it,",
    "And sprawled around, no longer wild.",
    "The jar was round upon the ground",
    "And tall and of a port in air.",
    "It took dominion everywhere.",
    "The jar was gray and bare.",
    "It did not give of bird or bush,",
    "Like nothing else in Tennessee."
