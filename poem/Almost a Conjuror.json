    "Remorse, which he used like fuzzy algebra. By pouring bluing",
    "On black porous coal, he crystallized, pronounced himself almost",
    "A sorcerer. He had an empty cloakroom",
    "In the chest of him.",
    "All the lost wool scarves",
    "Of all the world collected there & muffled him",
    "With wool.",
    "He imagined he could move a broom if he desired, just by wishing",
    "It. If he spoke of ghosts, he thought he could make of art vast",
    "Tattersall & spreading wings.",
    "When they found him in the nurse\u2019s office,",
    "He was awkward as a charlatan, slightly queasy",
    "In an emperor\u2019s real clothes.",
    "The thermos in his lunchbox was perpetually",
    "Broken and he lied. The small world smelled of oil",
    "Of peppermint, for a broken spell. Everything is plaid",
    "And sour in oblivion, as well."
