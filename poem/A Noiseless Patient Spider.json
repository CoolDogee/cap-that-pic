    "A noiseless patient spider,",
    "I mark\u2019d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,",
    "Mark\u2019d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,",
    "It launch\u2019d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,",
    "Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.",
    "And you O my soul where you stand,",
    "Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,",
    "Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,",
    "Till the bridge you will need be form\u2019d, till the ductile anchor hold,",
    "Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul."
