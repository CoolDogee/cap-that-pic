    "\u201cThey made her a grave, too cold and damp",
    "For a soul so warm and true;",
    "And she\u2019s gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,",
    "Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp,",
    "She paddles her white canoe.",
    "\u201cAnd her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,",
    "And her paddle I soon shall hear;",
    "Long and loving our life shall be,",
    "And I\u2019ll hide the maid in a cypress tree,",
    "When the footstep of death is near.\u201d",
    "Away to the Dismal Swamp he speeds\u2014",
    "His path was rugged and sore,",
    "Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,",
    "Through many a fen where the serpent feeds,",
    "And man never trod before.",
    "And when on the earth he sunk to sleep,",
    "If slumber his eyelids knew,",
    "He lay where the deadly vine doth weep",
    "Its venomous tear and nightly steep",
    "The flesh with blistering dew!",
    "And near him the she-wolf stirr\u2019d the brake,",
    "And the copper-snake breath\u2019d in his ear,",
    "Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,",
    "\u201cOh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,",
    "And the white canoe of my dear?\u201d",
    "He saw the Lake, and a meteor bright",
    "Quick over its surface play\u2019d\u2014",
    "\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, \u201cmy dear one\u2019s light!\u201d",
    "And the dim shore echoed for many a night",
    "The name of the death-cold maid.",
    "Till he hollow\u2019d a boat of the birchen bark,",
    "Which carried him off from shore;",
    "Far, far he follow\u2019d the meteor spark,",
    "The wind was high and the clouds were dark,",
    "And the boat return\u2019d no more.",
    "But oft, from the Indian hunter\u2019s camp,",
    "This lover and maid so true",
    "Are seen at the hour of midnight damp",
    "To cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,",
    "And paddle their white canoe!"
