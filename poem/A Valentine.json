    "The hunter to the husbandman",

    "And to love-loyalty dedicates",

    "Beauty of other shape and hue,",
    "Odd glinting graces of which none",
    "Shone more than candle to your sun;",
    "Your well-kissed hand was beckoning me",
    "In unfamiliar imagery.",
    "Smile your forgiveness: each bright ghost",
    "Dives in love\u2019s glory and is lost",
    "Yielding your comprehensive pride",
    "A homage, even to suicide."
