    "Could our first father, at his toilsome plow,",
    "Thorns in his path, and labor on his brow,",
    "Clothed only in a rude, unpolished skin,",
    "Could he a vain fantastic nymph have seen,",
    "In all her airs, in all her antic graces,",
    "Her various fashions, and more various faces;",
    "How had it posed that skill, which late assigned",
    "Just appellations to each several kind!",
    "A right idea of the sight to frame;",
    "T\u2019have guessed from what new element she came;",
    "T\u2019have hit the wav\u2019ring form, or giv\u2019n this thing a name."
