    "I write my name as one,",
    "On sands by waves o\u2019errun",
    "Or winter\u2019s frosted pane,",
    "Traces a record vain.",
    "Oblivion\u2019s blankness claims",
    "Wiser and better names,",
    "And well my own may pass",
    "As from the strand or glass.",
    "Wash on, O waves of time!",
    "Melt, noons, the frosty rime!",
    "Welcome the shadow vast,",
    "The silence that shall last!",
    "When I and all who know",
    "And love me vanish so,",
    "What harm to them or me",
    "Will the lost memory be?",
    "If any words of mine,",
    "Through right of life divine,",
    "Remain, what matters it",
    "Whose hand the message writ?",
    "Why should the \u201ccrowner\u2019s quest\u201d",
    "Sit on my worst or best?",
    "Why should the showman claim",
    "The poor ghost of my name?",
    "Yet, as when dies a sound",
    "Its spectre lingers round,",
    "Haply my spent life will",
    "Leave some faint echo still.",
    "A whisper giving breath",
    "Of praise or blame to death,",
    "Soothing or saddening such",
    "As loved the living much.",
    "Therefore with yearnings vain",
    "And fond I still would fain",
    "A kindly judgment seek,",
    "A tender thought bespeak.",
    "And, while my words are read,",
    "Let this at least be said:",
    "\u201cWhate\u2019er his life\u2019s defeatures,",
    "He loved his fellow-creatures.",
    "\u201cIf, of the Law\u2019s stone table,",
    "To hold he scarce was able",
    "The first great precept fast,",
    "He kept for man the last.",
    "\u201cThrough mortal lapse and dulness",
    "What lacks the Eternal Fulness,",
    "If still our weakness can",
    "Love Him in loving man?",
    "\u201cAge brought him no despairing",
    "Of the world\u2019s future faring;",
    "In human nature still",
    "He found more good than ill.",
    "\u201cTo all who dumbly suffered,",
    "His tongue and pen he offered;",
    "His life was not his own,",
    "Nor lived for self alone.",
    "\u201cHater of din and riot",
    "He lived in days unquiet;",
    "And, lover of all beauty,",
    "Trod the hard ways of duty.",
    "\u201cHe meant no wrong to any",
    "He sought the good of many,",
    "Yet knew both sin and folly,\u2014",
    "May God forgive him wholly!\u201d"
