    "I can\u2019t go to the east village anymore",
    "because it is like going on a tour",
    "of my worst dates. I get older, my heart",
    "leaps at the sight of children",
    "who don\u2019t belong to me, I pronounce",
    "everything like an Italian opera title.",
    "I used to listen to songs and have someone",
    "in mind for the you parts, now I just want",
    "to be where the light is intense, I want",
    "the kind of heat that kills you",

    "just as moved as if my faith were blind.",
    "When I speak of the blind, I mean",
    "the light. Truly the only things Lindsay Lohan and I",
    "have in common are our preoccupations",
    "with fame and weight loss, and yet I recognize",
    "a kinship there, as if those two things mattered",
    "more than anything. When I speak of",
    "the darkness, I mean this living.",
    "In a restaurant called Caracas,",
    "I once spent fifteen minutes arguing",
    "about an Ayn Rand book because",
    "every time he said",
    "I thought",
    "he meant",
    "and I said",
    "what dystopia, what about the woman,",
    "and he said what about the Home",
    "of the Infants and I said what",
    "Home of the Infants? What about",
    "loving a man so much you\u2019ll sleep",
    "with another man in order to finance",
    "the first man\u2019s tuberculosis treatment?",
    "Welcome to Russia, I said, and we",
    "were looking at each other and then",
    "not. I tried to picture Caracas, tried",
    "to leave him for elsewhere, a fever."
