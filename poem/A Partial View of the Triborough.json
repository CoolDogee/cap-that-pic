    "Ever since I was a boy, I\u2019ve found",
    "names, personalities as brittle, excuse me, as braille",
    "hints of interest, latched to the slightest",
    "meaning. Not parlance. Let me say power.",
    "The days rotate on their hinges. I can say I had",
    "friends. Sizable numbers, without delay, we were",
    "like, I don\u2019t know, an absence. A civilization.",
    "Prompt and unlike ourselves at all times: it was as if",
    "we could stand to burst, to rapidly be",
    "our own engines, rules, buildings, steel columns,",
    "iron beams. This is when I said I had a foundry.",
    "I had a scale, a summary and reflection, not",
    "the desire, but the capacity to be",
    "greater in titles and official things. Then I gave",
    "it up. I sunk hillsides and fields and ash dumps.",
    "I ran the concrete forth and I became the swarm,",
    "the throng, corporate in absurdity. Most people",
    "in opposition would say these are",
    "the words I\u2019ve prepared, while I am a speaker",
    "without my text, let the day surprise me.",
    "If it falls, it\u2019s me who gathers from idiosyncrasies",
    "sentences to shape a state and city."
