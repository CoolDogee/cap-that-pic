    "The rain\u2019s cold grains are silver-gray",
    "Sharp as golden sands,",
    "A bell is clanging, people sway",
    "Hanging by their hands.",
    "Supple hands, or gnarled and stiff,",
    "Snatch and catch and grope;",
    "That face is yellow-pale, as if",
    "The fellow swung from rope.",
    "Dull like pebbles, sharp like knives,",
    "Glances strike and glare,",
    "Fingers tangle, Bluebeard\u2019s wives",
    "Dangle by the hair.",
    "Orchard of the strangest fruits",
    "Hanging from the skies;",
    "Brothers, yet insensate brutes",
    "Who fear each others\u2019 eyes.",
    "One man stands as free men stand",
    "As if his soul might be",
    "Brave, unbroken; see his hand",
    "Nailed to an oaken tree."
