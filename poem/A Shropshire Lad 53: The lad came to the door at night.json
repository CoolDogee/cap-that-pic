    "The lad came to the door at night,",
    "When lovers crown their vows,",
    "And whistled soft and out of sight",
    "In shadow of the boughs.",
    "\u2018I shall not vex you with my face",
    "Henceforth, my love, for aye;",
    "So take me in your arms a space",
    "Before the east is grey.",
    "\u2018When I from hence away am past",
    "I shall not find a bride,",
    "And you shall be the first and last",
    "I ever lay beside.\u2019",
    "She heard and went and knew not why;",
    "Her heart to his she laid;",
    "Light was the air beneath the sky",
    "But dark under the shade.",
    "\u2018Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast",
    "Seems not to rise and fall,",
    "And here upon my bosom prest",
    "There beats no heart at all?\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,",
    "You should have felt it then;",
    "But since for you I stopped the clock",
    "It never goes again.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips",
    "Wet from your neck on mine?",
    "What is it falling on my lips,",
    "My lad, that tastes of brine?\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh like enough \u2019tis blood, my dear,",
    "For when the knife has slit",
    "The throat across from ear to ear",
    "\u2019Twill bleed because of it.\u2019"
