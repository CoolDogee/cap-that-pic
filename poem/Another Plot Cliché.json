    "My dear, you are the high-speed car chase, and I,",
    "I am the sheet of glass being carefully carried",
    "across the street by two employees of Acme Moving",
    "who have not parked on the right side",
    "because the plot demands that they make",
    "the perilous journey across traffic,",
    "and so they are cursing as rehearsed",
    "as they angle me into the street, acting as if",
    "they intend to get me to the department store, as if",
    "I will ever take my place as the display window, ever clear",
    "the way for a special exhibit at Christmas, or be Windexed",
    "once a day, or even late at night, be pressed against",
    "by a couple who can\u2019t make it back to his place,",
    "and so they angle me into the street, a bright lure,",
    "a provocative claim, their teaser, and indeed",
    "you can\u2019t resist my arguments, fatally flawed",
    "though they are, so you come careening to but and butt",
    "and rebut, you come careening, you being",
    "both cars, both chaser and chased, both good and bad, both",
    "done up with bullets that haven\u2019t yet done you in.",
    "I know I\u2019m done for: there\u2019s only one street",
    "on this set and you\u2019ve got a stubborn streak a mile long.",
    "I can smell the smoke already.",
    "No matter, I\u2019d rather shatter",
    "than be looked through all day. So come careening; I know",
    "you\u2019ve other clich\u00e9s to hammer home: women with groceries",
    "to send spilling, canals to leap as the bridge is rising.",
    "And me? I\u2019m so through. I\u2019ve got a thousand places to be."
