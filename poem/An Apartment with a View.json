    "I am in Rome, Vatican bells tolling",
    "a windowful of God and Bernini.",
    "My neighbor, the Pope, has died",
    "and God overnight, has wept",
    "black mantles over the sainted",
    "stone age whose skirted shadows",
    "flit through to the main cave.",
    "I nurse a cold. It must be error",
    "to sniffle in sight of holiness.",
    "\u201cLiquids,\u201d the doctor said. He has",
    "no cure, but since I have my choice,",
    "I sip champagne. If I must sit",
    "dropsical to Heaven, let me at least",
    "be ritual to a living water.",
    "In the crypt under the cave",
    "the stone box in its stone row",
    "has been marked for months now.",
    "My neighbor knew where he was going.",
    "I half suspect I, too, know,",
    "and that it is nothing to sneeze at,",
    "but am left to sneeze.",
    "I drink my ritual Mo\u00ebt et Chandon",
    "and wish (my taste being misformed",
    "for the high authentic) I had",
    "a California\u2014a Korbel",
    "or an Almaden. I like it \u201cforward,\u201d",
    "as clerics of such matters say,",
    "not schooled to greatness.",
    "It is loud in Heaven today",
    "and in the great stone school",
    "my neighbor kept.",
    "The alumni procession of saints",
    "is forming for him. Bells",
    "clobber the air with portents.",
    "I sniffle and sneeze,",
    "wad kleenex, and sip champagne,",
    "trying to imagine what it might be",
    "to take part in a greatness,",
    "or even in the illusion",
    "of something like. The experience",
    "might deepen my character,",
    "though I am already near",
    "the bottom of it, among wads and butts",
    "of what was once idea. And the last swallow",
    "I do not like the after-taste, if that",
    "is what I am tasting. But this is ritual.",
    "I toast my neighbor: may he",
    "find his glass, and may its after-taste",
    "be all that he was schooled to."
