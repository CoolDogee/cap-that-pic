    "Tell me not, in mournful numbers,",
    "Life is but an empty dream!",
    "For the soul is dead that slumbers,",
    "And things are not what they seem.",
    "Life is real! Life is earnest!",
    "And the grave is not its goal;",
    "Dust thou art, to dust returnest,",
    "Was not spoken of the soul.",
    "Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,",
    "Is our destined end or way;",
    "But to act, that each to-morrow",
    "Find us farther than to-day.",
    "Art is long, and Time is fleeting,",
    "And our hearts, though stout and brave,",
    "Still, like muffled drums, are beating",
    "Funeral marches to the grave.",
    "In the world\u2019s broad field of battle,",
    "In the bivouac of Life,",
    "Be not like dumb, driven cattle!",
    "Be a hero in the strife!",
    "Trust no Future, howe\u2019er pleasant!",
    "Let the dead Past bury its dead!",
    "Act,\u2014 act in the living Present!",
    "Heart within, and God o\u2019erhead!",
    "Lives of great men all remind us",
    "We can make our lives sublime,",
    "And, departing, leave behind us",
    "Footprints on the sands of time;",
    "Footprints, that perhaps another,",
    "Sailing o\u2019er life\u2019s solemn main,",
    "A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,",
    "Seeing, shall take heart again.",
    "Let us, then, be up and doing,",
    "With a heart for any fate;",
    "Still achieving, still pursuing,",
    "Learn to labor and to wait."
