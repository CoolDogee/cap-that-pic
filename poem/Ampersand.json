    "And had in fact, for generations\u2014",
    "the plump, open armed \u2018&\u2019 waving goodbye",
    "from the end of the old-world alphabet",
    "like an innkeeper framed in doorway candlelight,",
    "farewells swelled with hopes of come again.",
    "Then the old world burned down",
    "because we sensed, beyond the candle\u2019s glow,",
    "the road led to a dead end. No",
    "traveler returned, even the unverified",
    "odd reports of happy returns petered out.",
    "So we renovated the alphabet, signing it",
    "off with a streamlined \u2018z\u2019 as sharp",
    "and final as lightning: no sense",
    "in posting notice of further connections",
    "that didn\u2019t exist, or passing off maps as places.",
    "Trouble was, nobody felt at home",
    "in the revamped compound. Bookings fell off,",
    "postcards of views of blank walls piled unsold",
    "in the unvisited gift shop, the same",
    "paperbacks stalled on the revolving racks.",
    "It was a paradise of sorts, a golden age",
    "of nullity, no relatives",
    "breaking the costly silence. No wonder Eliot\u2019s",
    "befuddled Jacob Storey felt his page",
    "of Z\u2019s was somehow \u2018not right,\u2019 that",
    "\u2018it was a letter you never wanted hardly.\u2019",
    "He knew, as one newly released from the unlit",
    "cell of his long-unlettered ignorance,",
    "what you did want hardly: you wanted,",
    "needed\u2014as hardly as Hetty Sorrel,",
    "abandoned at the dock\u2014someone to stand by.",
    "You were the murderess of your baby,",
    "silenced with a \u2018z.\u2019 You needed a hand,",
    "the open-armed return of all your relations.",
    "You wanted, harder than death, ampersand"
