    "On the eighth day he coined the word \u201calone\u201d",
    "and saw that it was as good as everything else.",
    "A yellow school bus rattled down the lane,",
    "a wind blew in a drainpipe, strong, mellifluous.",
    "I brought two empty crates to the parking lot,",
    "watched neighbors with briefcases and car keys.",
    "At noon a mailman passed by where I sat",
    "invisible, like a tree among trees.",
    "Why, why, I asked. I wanted to know why,",
    "but only scared a squirrel that dropped his acorn",
    "when my voice broke silence unexpectedly\u2014",
    "a white noise in a wireless telephone.",
    "My club soda went flat in the bottle. With a spit",
    "of rain, a wind blew again from the lake.",
    "I raised my index finger and touched it,",
    "pleading, give me a break, give me a break."
