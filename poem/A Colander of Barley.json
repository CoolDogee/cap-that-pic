    "The smell, once water has rinsed it,",
    "is like a field of ripe grain, or the grain held",
    "in a truck, and if you climb the steel side,",
    "one foot lodged on the hubcap, the other",
    "on the wheel, and pull your body upward,",
    "your hands holding to tarp hooks, and lift toes",
    "onto the rim of the truck box, rest your ribs",
    "against the side, you will see beetles",
    "and grasshoppers among the hulled kernels.",
    "Water stirs and resurrects harvest dust:",
    "sun beating on abundance, the moist heat",
    "of grain collected in steel, hands",
    "plunging and lifting, the grain spilling back."
