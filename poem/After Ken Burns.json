    "The beautiful plate I cracked in half as I wrapped it in tissue paper\u2014",
    "as if the worship of a thing might be the thing that breaks it.",
    "This river, which is life, which is wayfaring. This river,",
    "which is also sky. This dipper, full of mind, which is",
    "not only the hysterical giggling of girls, but the trembling",
    "of the elderly. Not only",
    "the scales, beaks, and teeth of creatures, but also",
    "their imaginative names (",
    ") and their",
    "love of one another, the excited",
    "preparations they sometimes make",
    "for their own deaths.",
    "It is as if some graceful goddess, wandering in the dark, desperate with thirst, bent down and dropped that dipper",
    "clumsily in this river. It floated away.",
    ". . .",
    "The pineal gland, tiny pinecone in the forehead, our third eye: Of course",
    "it will happen here. No doubt. Someday, here,",
    "in this little house,",
    "they will lay the wounded side by side. The blood",
    "will run into the basement through the boards. Their ghosts are already here, along",
    "with the cracked plate wrapped in old paper in the attic,",
    "and the woman who will turn one day at the window to see",
    "a long strange line of vehicles traveling slowly toward her door, which",
    "she opens (what choice does she have?) although she has not yet been born."
