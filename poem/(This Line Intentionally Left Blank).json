    "even the gasp of the mime",

    "how many seconds",
    "all our minds shut some",
    "slamming others just a click",
    "like 300 parallel",
    "rows of tipped dominoes",
    "a racket of almost unison",
    "believe me we wouldn\u2019t",

    "but the truth",
    "so instantly and universally",

    "for something else",
    "which you could say we also got",
    "if you count the mime\u2019s",
    "unpleasant remark",
    "so she wasn\u2019t even a real mime",
    "probably part of what was",
    "clearly just a performance"
