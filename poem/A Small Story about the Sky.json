    "The fire was so fierce,",
    "So red, so gray, so yellow",
    "That, along with the land,",
    "It burned part of the sky",
    "Which stayed black in that corner",
    "For years,",
    "As if it were night there",
    "Even in the daytime,",
    "A piece of the sky burnt",
    "And which then",
    "Could not be counted on",
    "Even by the birds.",
    "It was a regular fire\u2014",
    "Terrible\u2014we forget this",
    "About fire\u2014terrible",
    "And full of pride.",
    "It intended to be",
    "Big, no regular fire.",
    "Like so many of us,",
    "It intended to be more",
    "And this time was.",
    "It was not better or worse",
    "Than any other fire",
    "Growing up.",
    "But this time, it was a fire",
    "At just the right time",
    "And in just the right place\u2014",
    "If you think like a fire\u2014",
    "A place it could do something big.",
    "Its flames reached out",
    "With ten thousand pincers,",
    "As if the fire",
    "Were made of beetles and scorpions",
    "Clawing themselves to get up,",
    "Pinching the air itself",
    "And climbing,",
    "So many sharp animals",
    "On each other\u2019s backs",
    "Then into the air itself,",
    "Ten thousand snaps and pinches",
    "At least,",
    "So that if the sky",
    "Was made of something,",
    "It could not get away this time.",
    "Finally the fire",
    "Caught the sky,",
    "Which acted like a slow rabbit",
    "Which had made a miscalculation.",
    "It didn\u2019t believe this could happen",
    "And so it ran left,",
    "Right into the thin toothpicks of flames,",
    "Too fast to pull back,",
    "The sky with all its arms,",
    "Hands, fingers, fingernails,",
    "All of it",
    "Disappeared.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "The sky stayed black",
    "For several years after.",
    "I wanted to tell you",
    "This small story",
    "About the sky.",
    "It\u2019s a good one",
    "And explains why the sky",
    "Comes so slowly in the morning,",
    "Still unsure of what\u2019s here.",
    "But the story is not mine.",
    "It was written by fire,",
    "That same small fire",
    "That wanted to come home",
    "With something of its own",
    "To tell,",
    "And it did,",
    "A small piece of blue in its mouth."
