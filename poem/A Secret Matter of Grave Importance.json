    "Except when once we drew identical lots",
    "nothing\u2019s ever come between us.",
    "We keep our drifts of space",
    "spare and daily shake our down.",
    "You\u2019ve glanced beyond your dirty cuffs",
    "and caught me hand-washing my clean shirts.",
    "Stuck with sharp wind, both",
    "bloods are rare and rarely do",
    "we taste the walnut\u2019s knot of oil.",
    "We wake between our fitted sheets",
    "and shake our fists or pretend real fright",
    "but not in this do we dare touch.",
    "My rib cage can stand in yours, yours",
    "become the swinging doors through which",
    "magician\u2019s swords will slice and miss",
    "that knotted muscle. It is a trick.",
    "We\u2019ll make an endless show of the outright",
    "clanking, irregular beating of our acrobatic hearts.",
    "We\u2019ve designed the double bars of depth;",
    "our hearts skip \u2014 the tumbleset we think",
    "is absence, the somersault we call forbearance",
    "\u2014 the hearts are there, doing turns that teach",
    "us to count and keep each finger",
    "close to its own sly pulse."
