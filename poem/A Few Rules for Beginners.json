    "Babies must not eat the coal",
    "And they must not make grimaces,",
    "Nor in party dresses roll",
    "And must never black their faces.",
    "They must learn that pointing\u2019s rude,",
    "They must sit quite still at table,",
    "And must always eat the food",
    "Put before them\u2014if they\u2019re able.",
    "If they fall, they must not cry,",
    "Though it\u2019s known how painful this is;",
    "No\u2014there\u2019s always Mother by",
    "Who will comfort them with kisses."
