    "No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief,",
    "More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring.",
    "Comforter, where, where is your comforting?",
    "Mary, mother of us, where is your relief?",
    "My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief",
    "Woe, w\u00f3rld-sorrow; on an \u00e1ge-old anvil wince and sing \u2014",
    "Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked 'No ling-",
    "ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief.\"'",
    "O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall",
    "Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap",
    "May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small",
    "Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep,",
    "Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all",
    "Life death does end and each day dies with sleep."
