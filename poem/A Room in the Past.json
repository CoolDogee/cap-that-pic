    "It\u2019s a kitchen. Its curtains fill",
    "with a morning light so bright",
    "you can\u2019t see beyond its windows",
    "into the afternoon. A kitchen",
    "falling through time with its things",
    "in their places, the dishes jingling",
    "up in the cupboard, the bucket",
    "of drinking water rippled as if",
    "a truck had just gone past, but that truck",
    "was thirty years. No one\u2019s at home",
    "in this room. Its counter is wiped,",
    "and the dishrag hangs from its nail,",
    "a dry leaf. In housedresses of mist,",
    "blue aprons of rain, my grandmother",
    "moved through this life like a ghost,",
    "and when she had finished her years,",
    "she put them all back in their places",
    "and wiped out the sink, turning her back",
    "on the rest of us, forever."
