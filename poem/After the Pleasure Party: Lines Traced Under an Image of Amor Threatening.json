    "Taking pride from love exempt,",
    "Fear me, slighted. Never, never",
    "Brave me, nor my fury tempt:",
    "Downy wings, but wroth they beat",
    "Tempest even in reason's seat.",
    "Behind the house the upland falls",
    "With many an odorous tree\u2014",
    "White marbles gleaming through green halls\u2014",
    "Terrace by terrace, down and down,",
    "And meets the star-lit Mediterranean Sea.",
    "\u2018Tis Paradise. In such an hour",
    "Some pangs that rend might take release.",
    "Nor less perturbed who keeps this bower",
    "Of balm, nor finds balsamic peace?",
    "From whom the passionate words in vent",
    "After long revery's discontent?",
    "\u201cTired of the homeless deep,",
    "Look how their flight yon hurrying billows urge,",
    "Hitherward but to reap",
    "Passive repulse from the iron-bound verge!",
    "Insensate, can they never know",
    "\u2019Tis mad to wreck the impulsion so?",
    "\u201cAn art of memory is, they tell:",
    "But to forget! forget the glade",
    "Wherein Fate sprung Love's ambuscade,",
    "To flout pale years of cloistral life",
    "And flush me in this sensuous strife.",
    "\u2019Tis Vesta struck with Sappho's smart.",
    "No fable her delirious leap:",
    "With more of cause in desperate heart,",
    "Myself could take it\u2014but to sleep!",
    "\u201cNow first I feel, what all may ween,",
    "That soon or late, if faded e'en,",
    "One's sex asserts itself. Desire,",
    "The dear desire through love to sway,",
    "Is like the Geysers that aspire\u2014",
    "Through cold obstruction win their fervid way.",
    "But baffled here\u2014to take disdain,",
    "To feel rule's instinct, yet not reign;",
    "To dote, to come to this drear shame\u2014",
    "Hence the winged blaze that sweeps my soul",
    "Like prairie-fires that spurn control,",
    "Where withering weeds incense the flame.",
    "\u201cAnd kept I long heaven's watch for this,",
    "Contemning love, for this, even this?",
    "O terrace chill in Northern air,",
    "O reaching ranging tube I placed",
    "Against yon skies, and fable chased",
    "Till, fool, I hailed for sister there",
    "Starred Cassiopea in Golden Chair.",
    "In dream I throned me, nor I saw",
    "In cell the idiot crowned with straw.",
    "\u201cAnd yet, ah yet, scarce ill I reigned,",
    "Through self-illusion self-sustained,",
    "When now\u2014enlightened, undeceived\u2014",
    "What gain I, barrenly bereaved!",
    "Than this can be yet lower decline\u2014",
    "Envy and spleen, can these be mine?",
    "\u201cThe peasant-girl demure that trod",
    "Beside our wheels that climbed the way,",
    "And bore along a blossoming rod",
    "That looked the sceptre of May-Day\u2014",
    "On her\u2014to fire this petty hell,",
    "His softened glance how moistly fell!",
    "The cheat! on briers her buds were strung;",
    "And wiles peeped forth from mien how meek.",
    "The innocent bare-foot! young, so young!",
    "To girls, strong man's a novice weak.",
    "To tell such beads! And more remain,",
    "Sad rosary of belittling pain.",
    "\u201cWhen after lunch and sallies gay",
    "Like the Decameron folk we lay",
    "In sylvan groups; and I\u2014let be!",
    "O, dreams he, can he dream that one",
    "Because not roseate feels no sun?",
    "The plain lone bramble thrills with Spring",
    "As much as vines that grapes shall bring.",
    "\u201cMe now fair studies charm no more.",
    "Shall great thoughts writ, or high themes sung",
    "Damask wan cheeks\u2014unlock his arm",
    "About some radiant ninny flung?",
    "How glad with all my starry lore,",
    "I'd buy the veriest wanton's rose",
    "Would but my bee therein repose.",
    "\u201cCould I remake me! or set free",
    "This sexless bound in sex, then plunge",
    "Deeper than Sappho, in a lunge",
    "Piercing Pan's paramount mystery!",
    "For, Nature, in no shallow surge",
    "Against thee either sex may urge,",
    "Why hast thou made us but in halves\u2014",
    "Co-relatives? This makes us slaves.",
    "If these co-relatives never meet",
    "Self-hood itself seems incomplete.",
    "And such the dicing of blind fate",
    "Few matching halves here meet and mate.",
    "What Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder",
    "The human integral clove asunder",
    "And shied the fractions through life's gate?",
    "\u201cYe stars that long your votary knew",
    "Rapt in her vigil, see me here!",
    "Whither is gone the spell ye threw",
    "When rose before me Cassiopea?",
    "Usurped on by love's stronger reign\u2014",
    "But, lo, your very selves do wane:",
    "Light breaks\u2014truth breaks! Silvered no more,",
    "But chilled by dawn that brings the gale",
    "Shivers yon bramble above the vale,",
    "And disillusion opens all the shore.\u201d",
    "One knows not if Urania yet",
    "The pleasure-party may forget;",
    "Or whether she lived down the strain",
    "Of turbulent heart and rebel brain;",
    "For Amor so resents a slight,",
    "And hers had been such haught disdain,",
    "He long may wreak his boyish spite,",
    "And boy-like, little reck the pain.",
    "One knows not, no. But late in Rome",
    "(For queens discrowned a congruous home)",
    "Entering Albani's porch she stood",
    "Fixed by an antique pagan stone",
    "Colossal carved. No anchorite seer,",
    "Not Thomas a Kempis, monk austere,",
    "Religious more are in their tone;",
    "Yet far, how far from Christian heart",
    "That form august of heathen Art.",
    "Swayed by its influence, long she stood,",
    "Till surged emotion seething down,",
    "She rallied and this mood she won:",
    "\u201cLanguid in frame for me,",
    "To-day by Mary's convent-shrine,",
    "Touched by her picture's moving plea",
    "In that poor nerveless hour of mine,",
    "I mused\u2014A wanderer still must grieve.",
    "Half I resolved to kneel and believe,",
    "Believe and submit, the veil take on.",
    "But thee, arm\u2019d Virgin! less benign,",
    "Thee now I invoke, thou mightier one.",
    "Helmeted woman\u2014if such term",
    "Befit thee, far from strife",
    "Of that which makes the sexual feud",
    "And clogs the aspirant life\u2014",
    "O self-reliant, strong and free,",
    "Thou in whom power and peace unite,",
    "Transcender! raise me up to thee,",
    "Raise me and arm me!\u201d",
    "Fond appeal.",
    "For never passion peace shall bring,",
    "Nor Art inanimate for long",
    "Inspire. Nothing may help or heal",
    "While Amor incensed remembers wrong.",
    "Vindictive, not himself he\u2019ll spare;",
    "For scope to give his vengeance play",
    "Himself he'll blaspheme and betray.",
    "Then for Urania, virgins everywhere,",
    "O pray! Example take too, and have care."
