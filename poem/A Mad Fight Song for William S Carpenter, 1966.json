    "Quick on my feet in those Novembers of my loneliness,",
    "I tossed a short pass,",
    "Almost the instant I got the ball, right over the head",
    "Of Barrel Terry before he knocked me cold.",
    "When I woke, I found myself crying out",
    "Latin conjugations, and the new snow falling",
    "At the edge of a green field.",
    "Lemoyne Crone had caught the pass, while I lay",
    "Unconscious and raging",
    "Alone with the fire ghost of Catullus, the contemptuous graces tossing",
    "Garlands and hendecasyllabics over the head",
    "Of Cornelius Nepos the mastodon,",
    "The huge volume.",
    "At the edges of Southeast Asia this afternoon",
    "The quarterbacks and the lines are beginning to fall,",
    "A spring snow,",
    "And terrified young men",
    "Quick on their feet",
    "Lob one another\u2019s skulls across",
    "Wings of strange birds that are burning",
    "Themselves alive."
