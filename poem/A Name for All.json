    "Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page",
    "And still wing on, untarnished of the name",
    "We pinion to your bodies to assuage",
    "Our envy of your freedom\u2014we must maim",
    "Because we are usurpers, and chagrined\u2014",
    "And take the wing and scar it in the hand.",
    "Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;",
    "But we must die, as you, to understand.",
    "I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang",
    "As only they can praise, who build their days",
    "With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang",
    "Struck free and holy in one Name always."
