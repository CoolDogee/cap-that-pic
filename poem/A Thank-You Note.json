    "My daughter made drawings with the pens you sent,",
    "line drawings that suggest the things they represent,",
    "different from any drawings she \u2014 at ten \u2014 had done,",
    "closer to real art, implying what the mind fills in.",
    "For her mother she made a flower fragile on its stem;",
    "for me, a lion, calm, contained, but not a handsome one.",
    "She drew a lion for me once before, on a get-well card,",
    "and wrote I must be brave even when it\u2019s hard.",
    "Such love is healing \u2014 as you know, my friend,",
    "especially when it comes unbidden from our children",
    "despite the flaws they see so vividly in us.",
    "Who can love you as your child does?",
    "Your son so ill, the brutal chemo, his looming loss",
    "owning you now \u2014 yet you would be this generous",
    "to think of my child. With the pens you sent",
    "she has made I hope a healing instrument."
