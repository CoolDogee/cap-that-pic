    "On the idle hill of summer,",

    "On the roads of earth go by,",
    "Dear to friends and food for powder,",
    "Soldiers marching, all to die.",
    "East and west on fields forgotten",
    "Bleach the bones of comrades slain,",
    "Lovely lads and dead and rotten;",
    "None that go return again.",
    "Far the calling bugles hollo,",
    "High the screaming fife replies,",
    "Gay the files of scarlet follow:",
    "Woman bore me, I will rise."
