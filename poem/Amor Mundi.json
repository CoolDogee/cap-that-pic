    "\u201cOh where are you going with your love-locks flowing",
    "On the west wind blowing along this valley track?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,",
    "We shall escape the uphill by never turning back.\u201d",
    "So they two went together in glowing August weather,",
    "The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;",
    "And dear she was to dote on, her swift feet seemed to float on",
    "The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.",
    "\u201cOh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven,",
    "Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh that\u2019s a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,",
    "An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,",
    "Their scent comes rich and sickly?\u201d\u2014\u201cA scaled and hooded worm.\u201d",
    "\u201cOh what\u2019s that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?\u201d",
    "\u201cOh that\u2019s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term.\u201d",
    "\u201cTurn again, O my sweetest,\u2014turn again, false and fleetest:",
    "This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell\u2019s own track.\u201d",
    "\u201cNay, too steep for hill-mounting; nay, too late for cost-counting:",
    "This downhill path is easy, but there\u2019s no turning back.\u201d"
