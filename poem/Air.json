    "Air as lost time",
    "Voice of a cloud, of a ghost crowned with nimbus",
    "Smack-thin, it lingers forty years",
    "I thought it came from the jeweled world we\u2019d seen",
    "Everything stuffed, urgent, glittering alive",
    "But it was just pleasure, blank and sure",
    "Now what is there to sing",
    "From speakers, the tune folds and fades in waves",
    "Earphones drive it through your head"
