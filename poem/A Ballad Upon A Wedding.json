    "I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,",
    "Where I the rarest things have seen;",
    "Oh, things without compare!",
    "Such sights again cannot be found",
    "In any place on English ground,",
    "Be it at wake, or fair.",
    "At Charing-Cross, hard by the way,",
    "Where we (thou know\u2019st) do sell our hay,",
    "There is a house with stairs;",
    "And there did I see coming down",
    "Such folk as are not in our town,",
    "Vorty, at least, in pairs.",
    "Amongst the rest, one pest\u2019lent fine",
    "(His beard no bigger though than thine)",
    "Walk\u2019d on before the rest:",
    "Our landlord looks like nothing to him:",
    "The King (God bless him) \u2019twould undo him,",
    "Should he go still so drest.",
    "At Course-a-Park, without all doubt,",
    "He should have first been taken out",
    "By all the maids i\u2019th\u2019 town:",
    "Though lusty Roger there had been,",
    "Or little George upon the Green,",
    "Or Vincent of the Crown.",
    "But wot you what? the youth was going",
    "To make an end of all his wooing;",
    "The parson for him stay\u2019d:",
    "Yet by his leave (for all his haste),",
    "He did not so much wish all past",
    "(Perchance), as did the maid.",
    "The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)",
    "For such a maid no Whitsun-ale",
    "Could ever yet produce:",
    "No grape, that\u2019s kindly ripe, could be",
    "So round, so plump, so soft as she,",
    "Nor half so full of juice.",
    "Her finger was so small, the ring",
    "Would not stay on, which they did bring;",
    "It was too wide a peck:",
    "And to say truth (for out it must)",
    "It look\u2019d like the great collar (just)",
    "About our young colt\u2019s neck.",
    "Her feet beneath her petticoat,",
    "Like little mice, stole in and out,",
    "As if they fear\u2019d the light:",
    "But oh! she dances such a way",
    "No sun upon an Easter-day",
    "Is half so fine a sight.",
    "He would have kissed her once or twice,",
    "But she would not, she was nice,",
    "She would not do\u2019t in sight,",
    "And then she looked as who should say",
    "I will do what I list to day;",
    "And you shall do\u2019t at night.",
    "Her cheeks so rare a white was on,",
    "No daisy makes comparison,",
    "(Who sees them is undone);",
    "For streaks of red were mingled there,",
    "Such as are on a Catherine pear",
    "(The side that\u2019s next the sun).",
    "Her lips were red, and one was thin,",
    "Compar\u2019d to that was next her chin;",
    "(Some bee had stung it newly);",
    "But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face,",
    "I durst no more upon them gaze",
    "Than on the sun in July.",
    "Her mouth so small, when she does speak,",
    "Thou\u2019dst swear her teeth her words did break,",
    "That they might passage get;",
    "But she so handled still the matter,",
    "They came as good as ours, or better,",
    "And are not spent a whit.",
    "If wishing should be any sin,",
    "The Parson himself had guilty been;",
    "(She looked that day so purely,)",
    "And did the youth so oft the feat",
    "At night, as some did in conceit,",
    "It would have spoil\u2019d him, surely.",
    "Passion o\u2019 me, how I run on!",
    "There\u2019s that that would be thought upon",
    "(I trow) besides the bride.",
    "The business of the kitchen\u2019s great,",
    "For it is fit that men should eat;",
    "Nor was it there denied.",
    "Just in the nick the cook knock\u2019d thrice,",
    "And all the waiters in a trice",
    "His summons did obey:",
    "Each serving-man, with dish in hand,",
    "March\u2019d boldly up, like our train\u2019d band,",
    "Presented, and away.",
    "When all the meat was on the table,",
    "What man of knife or teeth was able",
    "To stay to be intreated?",
    "And this the very reason was,",
    "Before the parson could say grace,",
    "The company was seated.",
    "Now hats fly off, and youths carouse,",
    "Healths first go round, and then the house,",
    "The bride\u2019s came thick and thick;",
    "And when \u2019twas nam\u2019d another\u2019s health,",
    "Perhaps he made it hers by stealth;",
    "And who could help it, Dick?",
    "O\u2019 th\u2019 sudden up they rise and dance;",
    "Then sit again and sigh, and glance;",
    "Then dance again and kiss:",
    "Thus sev\u2019ral ways the time did pass,",
    "Whilst ev\u2019ry woman wish\u2019d her place,",
    "And ev\u2019ry man wish\u2019d his.",
    "By this time all were stol\u2019n aside",
    "To counsel and undress the Bride;",
    "But that he must not know:",
    "But yet \u2019twas thought he guess\u2019d her mind,",
    "And did not mean to stay behind",
    "Above an hour or so.",
    "When in he came (Dick) there she lay",
    "Like new-fal\u2019n snow melting away,",
    "(\u2019Twas time I trow to part)",
    "Kisses were now the only stay,",
    "Which soon she gave, as who would say,",
    "Good Boy! with all my heart.",
    "But just as heav\u2019ns would have to cross it,",
    "In came the Bridemaids with the Posset:",
    "The Bridegroom eat in spite;",
    "For had he left the Women to\u2019t",
    "It would have cost two hours to do\u2019t,",
    "Which were too much that night.",
    "At length the candles out and out,",
    "All that they had not done, they do\u2019t:",
    "What that is, who can tell?",
    "But I believe it was no more",
    "Then thou and I have done before",
    "With Bridget, and with Nell."
