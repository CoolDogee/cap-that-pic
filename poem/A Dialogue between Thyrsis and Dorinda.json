    "When death shall part us from these kids,",
    "And shut up our divided lids,",
    "Tell me, Thyrsis, prithee do,",
    "Whither thou and I must go.",
    "To the Elysium.",
    "Oh, where is\u2019t?",
    "A chaste soul can never miss\u2019t.",
    "I know no way but to our home,",
    "Is our cell Elysium?",
    "Turn thine eye to yonder sky,",
    "There the milky way doth lie;",
    "\u2019Tis a sure but rugged way,",
    "That leads to everlasting day.",
    "There birds may nest, but how can I",
    "That have no wings and cannot fly?",
    "Do not sigh, fair nymph, for fire",
    "Hath no wings yet doth aspire",
    "Till it hit against the Pole:",
    "Heaven\u2019s the centre of the soul.",
    "But in Elysium how do they",
    "Pass eternity away?",
    "Oh, there\u2019s neither hope nor fear,",
    "There\u2019s no wolf, no fox, no bear.",
    "No need of dog to fetch our stray,",
    "Our Lightfoot we may give away;",
    "No oat-pipe\u2019s needful; there thy ears",
    "May sleep with music of the spheres.",
    "Oh sweet! Oh sweet! How I my future state",
    "By silent thinking antedate:",
    "I prithee let us spend our time to come",
    "In talking of Elysium.",
    "Then I\u2019ll go on. There sheep are full",
    "Of sweetest grass and softest wool;",
    "There birds sing consorts, garlands grow,",
    "Cool winds do whisper, springs do flow.",
    "There always is a rising sun,",
    "And day is ever but begun.",
    "Shepherds there bear equal sway,",
    "And every nymph\u2019s a Queen of May.",
    "Ah me, ah me!",
    "Dorinda, why dost cry?",
    "I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m sick, and fain would die.",
    "Convince me now that this is true",
    "By bidding with me all adieu.",
    "I cannot live without thee, I,",
    "I\u2019ll for thee, much more with thee, die.",
    "Then let us give Corillo charge o\u2019 the sheep,",
    "And thou and I\u2019ll pick poppies, and them steep",
    "In wine, and drink on\u2019t even till we weep,",
    "So shall we smoothly pass away in sleep."
