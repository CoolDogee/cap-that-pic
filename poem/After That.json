    "Every story has its lean meat",
    "and its solid church",
    "so he started to rape her for years.",
    "However, owls close their eyes",
    "in the daytime",
    "because they\u2019re awake all night,",
    "and she waited for him",
    "at the handle of his hunting knife",
    "the bells ringing afterward",
    "with the kind of lust",
    "she\u2019s always known.",
    "After that her flights were silent",
    "and her voice, of rats and mice.",
    "I don\u2019t understand sorcery or omens",
    "even eyes as penetrating as hers,",
    "but under her feathers",
    "and all along the tips of her flight",
    "where she\u2019s let me touch her,",
    "I\u2019ve kissed her fright."
