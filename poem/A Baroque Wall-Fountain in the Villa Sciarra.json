    "Under the bronze crown",
    "Too big for the head of the stone cherub whose feet",
    "A serpent has begun to eat,",
    "Sweet water brims a cockle and braids down",
    "Past spattered mosses, breaks",
    "On the tipped edge of a second shell, and fills",
    "The massive third below. It spills",
    "In threads then from the scalloped rim, and makes",
    "A scrim or summery tent",
    "For a faun-m\u00e9nage and their familiar goose.",
    "Happy in all that ragged, loose",
    "Collapse of water, its effortless descent",
    "And flatteries of spray,",
    "The stocky god upholds the shell with ease,",
    "Watching, about his shaggy knees,",
    "The goatish innocence of his babes at play;",
    "His fauness all the while",
    "Leans forward, slightly, into a clambering mesh",
    "Of water-lights, her sparkling flesh",
    "In a saecular ecstasy, her blinded smile",
    "Bent on the sand floor",
    "Of the trefoil pool, where ripple-shadows come",
    "And go in swift reticulum,",
    "More addling to the eye than wine, and more",
    "Interminable to thought",
    "Than pleasure\u2019s calculus. Yet since this all",
    "Is pleasure, flash, and waterfall,",
    "Must it not be too simple? Are we not",
    "More intricately expressed",
    "In the plain fountains that Maderna set",
    "Before St. Peter\u2019s\u2014the main jet",
    "Struggling aloft until it seems at rest",
    "In the act of rising, until",
    "The very wish of water is reversed,",
    "That heaviness borne up to burst",
    "In a clear, high, cavorting head, to fill",
    "With blaze, and then in gauze",
    "Delays, in a gnatlike shimmering, in a fine",
    "Illumined version of itself, decline,",
    "And patter on the stones its own applause?",
    "If that is what men are",
    "Or should be, if those water-saints display",
    "The pattern of our aret",
    ",",
    "What of these showered fauns in their bizarre,",
    "Spangled, and plunging house?",
    "They are at rest in fulness of desire",
    "For what is given, they do not tire",
    "Of the smart of the sun, the pleasant water-douse",
    "And riddled pool below,",
    "Reproving our disgust and our ennui",
    "With humble insatiety.",
    "Francis, perhaps, who lay in sister snow",
    "Before the wealthy gate",
    "Freezing and praising, might have seen in this",
    "No trifle, but a shade of bliss\u2014",
    "That land of tolerable flowers, that state",
    "As near and far as grass",
    "Where eyes become the sunlight, and the hand",
    "Is worthy of water: the dreamt land",
    "Toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures pass."
