    "Come for duty\u2019s sake (as girls do) we watch",
    "The sly very old woman wile away from her pious",
    "And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.",
    "She pours big drinks. We think of what",
    "Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in",
    "And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,",
    "Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,",
    "Now Babel, then of ivory, of the Shulamite,",
    "Collapsed to this keen dame moving among",
    "Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright",
    "Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here",
    "My child, and feeling it, dear. A crooking finger",
    "Shows how hot the oven is.",
    "(Also she is alive with hate.",
    "Also she is afraid of hell. Also, we wish",
    "We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,",
    "Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)",
    "Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still",
    "Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.",
    "We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.",
    "We learn time\u2019s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.",
    "We\u2019re dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin",
    "To any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,",
    "Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure."
